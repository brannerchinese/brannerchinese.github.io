		<div><p>A correspondent used the term Emailyama* a few days ago. I admire his
ability to defer looking at email at all for what seems to be long
periods — many days — and replying to serious message even less often,
after a considerable length of time. Like me, he has chosen not to
subscribe to a data plan for his mobile phone and has just simple voice
service on it. I believe I can learn to do what he does to avoid the
Emailyama. Of course, when you leave email alone for a while, it
accumulates. Is the Emailyama stronger or weaker then? A puzzle. But it
is better to face him on your own terms and at times of your own
choosing.</p>
<p>The period when I have done without email for the longest — I mean, when
I had regular access to email but chose not to use it — was when I was
finishing my dissertation some 15 years ago. I allowed myself 20
minutes, twice a day, for all internet access unconnected to my
research. I didn't really miss it. I also took two hour-long walks every
day, regardless of weather, at that time.</p>
<p>During my fieldwork trips I almost never had email; an American friend
let me use his account occasionally when I was in the same city he was,
but it was a minor part of my life — I spent a lot more time watching
the early-morning slaughtering of pigs (to learn the names of butchering
processes and body parts) and trying to make accurate records of dialect
idioms, improvised dialect songs (<em>shān'gē</em> 山歌) of very old farm
women, names of local plants and places, and secret language. Email
would have seemed a terrific bore in comparison with those things.</p>
