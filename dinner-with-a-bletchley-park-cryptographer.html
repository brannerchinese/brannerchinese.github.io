		<div><p>Michael Loewe, the eminent Cambridge historian of China, came to speak
at the Institute for Advanced Study and at Princeton University on 19–20
November of this year. A few of the sinologists from the School of
Historical Studies at the IAS dined with him after his first talk. I had
not realized that Loewe had once been at Bletchley Park and that his
initiation into the languages of East Asia came in a rudimentary course
in Japanese, hurriedly thrown together for Bletchley workers in the
weeks after Pearl Harbor. It began in February, 1942.</p>
<p>Living as I now do in the oddly-configured space between sinology and
computer science, the conversation was a particular delight for me.
Bletchley Park is one of the landmarks in the evolution of computer
science before the invention of the transistor. And while I am not prone
to the worship of people or things, it was a pleasure to have the
company of this hale 91-year old scholar for an evening and hear him
reminisce in his own voice about cryptography seventy years ago.</p>
<p>Loewe told us a number of stories of Bletchley, and I won't repeat them
here as I see they are essentially all documented in his seven-page
paper "Japanese Naval Codes" in the Hinsley and Stripp <em>Codebreakers</em>
book.[1] I had not read this book before, and would like to recommend it
here. It is thickly stocked with personal memoirs of the Bletchley Park
work by thirty different participants, and should satisfy any reader's
hunger for historical and technical detail.</p>
<p>While Bletchley is most famous for the reconstruction-at-a-distance of
the settings of the Enigma machine, associated in memory with the
stellar name of Alan Turing, I was more impressed by the descriptions of
the collaborative nature of all the cryptographic work and of the study
of Tunny and Sturgeon — code names for the two other German
cryptographic machines. And still more striking was to realize how much
of the work at Bletchley was of no Computer-Science interest at all. It
was exceedingly dreary clerical labor, performed manually at all hours
of the day, because the vast majority of Axis cryptographic tools
consisted of simple ciphers and codes, applied by hand to plaintext and
then decoded by hand. If there is any Computer-Science lesson in all
this drudgery, it is only that automation initially enabled ciphers to
resist decryption more robustly and to introduce greater
variability-with-reproducibility to the encryption process; that
robustness and reproducibility are what drove Turing and the others to
their mathematical advances. As for Japanese, Loewe and the other
Bletchley writers make clear how minor a subject it was in English
wartime cryptography. All the work they did on it was clerical in nature
and very low-level.</p>
<hr />
<p>I was charmed by Loewe's accent. I transcribed a few distinctive
expressions:</p>
<ul>
<li>[mai-θə-ˈlɒ-dʒɪ-kl̩]: mythological</li>
<li>[ˈju-njukʰ]: eunuch</li>
<li>[ˈɛm-pʰɹʌ]: emperor</li>
<li>[ˈlai-bɹiː]: library</li>
<li>full trust of his loyalty: I would use "in" rather than "of" here.</li>
<li>a forward protagonist</li>
</ul>
<p>The first two of these were completely new to me and surprising. He also
pronounced the second half of Milton Keynes, the major town near
Bletchley Park (now the borough containing it), as [kʰeinz]. He gave the
name of the course of study in (Western) Classics that he had been
enrolled in at Cambridge before Bletchley as "Classical Mods" — short
for Classical Moderations, a name that remains in use today. The
expression "moderations" apparently has to do with the fact that this
curriculum features examination by disputation, conducted by faculty
"moderators". Good training for sinology and cryptography, even if of
the dreary clerical variety.</p>
<p>Loewe's surname is pronounced ['lou-wiː].</p>

<p>[1] F. H. Hinsley and Alan Stripp, eds., <em>Codebreakers</em> (Oxford: Oxford
University Press, [1993] 1994 [paperback]), pp. 257–63. This is quite a
different work from David Kahn's <em>Codebreakers</em>, a more general history
of cryptography.</p></div>
