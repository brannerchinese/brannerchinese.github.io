		<div><p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) specified Python as
the language of choice for coding a program to report contractual
cash-flow provisions.</p>
<p>Their reasons were two:</p>
<ol>
<li>Python is open source, hence not susceptible to proprietary
    restrictions on users.</li>
<li>Python is interpreted, hence more transparent than compiled
    executable code, and so less likely to contain malicious
    functionality.</li>
</ol>
<p>The key passage in this 667-page document follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are proposing new Rule 314 of Regulation S-T to require that the
waterfall computer program be written in the Python programming
language and be filed as source code that is able to be downloaded and
run on a local computer properly configured with a Python interpreter.
As we note above, Python is an open source interpreted programming
language. Open source means that the source code is available to all
users (as opposed to proprietary source code that can be viewed only
by the owner or developer of the program). An interpreted language is
a programming language that requires an interpreter in the target
computer for program execution. We prohibit the inclusion of
executable code in electronic submissions on EDGAR because of the
computer security risks posed by accepting executable code for filing.
Executable code results from separately compiling a computer program
prior to running it. Since Python is an interpreted language that does
not need to be compiled prior to running it, executable code would not
need to be published on EDGAR, and we would not require EDGAR to
establish facilities to host, run, or operate any computer program.
The waterfall computer program source code would be required to be
submitted as tagged XML data. The EDGAR Technical Specification would
contain detailed information on how to file the waterfall computer
program.</p>
