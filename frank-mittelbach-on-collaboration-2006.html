<blockquote>
<p>I do indeed like to collaborate and over the years worked successfully
with many different people (on various topics and in different subject
domains). For me the main value of collaboration is during the
development of ideas which, in my experience, are best produced in an
open exchange. My mental picture here is a table tennis or similar
game which only develops if one directly reacts to whatever your
counterpart thinks of and “picks up the ball as played”. People who
have worked with me know that I like white board drawing sessions (I
do need to visualize while I play along) and brainstorming and mind
mapping methods.</p>
<p>But I’m also a stickler for details and can spend a lot of energy and
effort in actually finishing something (to my own satisfaction) when I
consider it worthwhile. Collaboration on that level — after the
initial concept and design development work has finished and the nitty
gritty detail work starts — normally takes one of two forms: either I
restrict myself largely to mentoring and let others work on actual
implementations, or I put so much energy into a certain task that it
outweighs other people’s involvement by a large factor. My base motto
here is “<em>Es gibt nichts Gutes, außer man tut es</em>” (free translation:
Nothing good will come into existence unless you actually do it) by
Erich Kästner which at least in the German language nicely rhymes.</p>
<p>A lot of collaboration necessarily happens via email (due to living in
different countries, etc.), but I find it extremely valuable to
interrupt this method of working at irregular intervals with
face-to-face meetings to flesh out ideas and make them concrete enough
to go ahead for a while in semi-isolation with only email and or phone
calls as the means of “direct” communication. This also explains why
most of the more fundamental work that is associated with Rainer
Schöpf’s and my names dates from the time when we both studied at the
University and had a chance for a more regular exchange of ideas in
front of white boards (drinking gallons of tea).</p>
