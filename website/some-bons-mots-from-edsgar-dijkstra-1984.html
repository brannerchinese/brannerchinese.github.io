<p>Gone are the days when Niklaus Wirth unmistakably identified himself
by his typewriter and you could recognize his writings even when they
were held upside down.</p>
<hr />
<p></p>
Nowadays machines are so fast and stores are so huge that in a very
true sense the computations we can evoke defy our imagination. Machine
capacities now give us room galore for making a mess of it.
Opportunities unlimited for fouling things up! Developing the austere
intellectual discipline of keeping things sufficiently simple is in
this environment a formidable challenge, both technically and
educationally.</p>
<hr />
<p></p>
Complexity continues to have a morbid attraction. When you give for an
academic audience a lecture that is crystal clear from alpha to omega,
your audience feels cheated and leaves the lecture hall commenting to
each other: "That was rather trivial, wasn't it?" The sore truth is
that complexity sells better. (It is not only the computer industry
that has discovered that.) And it is even more diabolical in that we
even use the complexity of our own constructs to impress ourselves. I
have often been impressed by the cleverness of my own first solutions;
invariably the joy of the subsequent discovery how to streamline the
argument was tempered by a feeling of regret that my cleverness was
unnecessary after all. It is a genuine sacrifice to part from one's
ingenuities, no matter how contorted, Also, many a programmer derives
a major part of his professional excitement from not quite
understanding what he is doing, from the daring risks he takes and
from the struggle to find the bugs he should not have introduced in
the first place.</p>
<hr />
<p></p>
The intrinsic difficulty of the programming task has never been
refuted, it has only been denied because admitting it was socially
unacceptable. Not surprisingly, research in programming methodology
has not flourished in societies unable to admit that the programming
problem was serious.</p>
<hr />
<p></p>
Software engineering … has sought to replace intellectual discipline
by management discipline to the extent that it has now accepted as its
charter "How to program if you cannot."</p>
<hr />
<p></p>
Taken literally, ["user-friendliness"] is like the term "motherhood":
nobody can be against it, so it means nothing. And hence, if the term
"user-friendliness" is given a meaning, it must be a terrible
euphemism for something else.</p>
<hr />
<p></p>
It is regrettable that large groups only come to their senses after
their day-dreams have turned into nightmares but, this being so, we
should occasionally welcome the nightmares.</p>
