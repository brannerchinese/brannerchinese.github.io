		<div><p>This morning my accomplice and I ordered three dishes and were quite
satisfied.</p>
<p>​1. 拌面 Yellow Noodle with Peanut Sauce. An old standby of Fúzhōu
comfort food, closely related to the "cold noodles in sesame sauce" that
became popular because of Empire Szechwan in the 1970s. Made with flat
noodles, which the sauce keeps from sticking together. The sauce was not
excessively sweet. Quite satisfactory, though this is not the sort of
food to earn high ratings in any case.</p>
<p>​2. 豬肚罐 Pig Stomach in Can. There is no can. This is a delicious soup
slow-cooked in a cylindrical porcelain vessel, the same kind used for
decocting medicine. (To keep up with the crush of business they prepare
the soup somewhere else and freeze it, heating up each portion to order
in the store.) The consistency of the tripe (which was clean) was
perfect, and the soup — made with plenty of celery and small black
mushrooms (香菇) — was delectable. Well worth another visit.</p>
<p>​3. 芋鴨粉乾 Duck &amp; Taro Vermicelli. Noodle soup, made with a stock less
tasty than the "pig stomach in can", above. The noodles are not the
usual ultra-fine "vermicelli" but a white, rice-flour noodle the
thickness and consistency of overcooked spaghetti. Basically
inoffensive, but not "vermicelli". The pieces of duck and taro and black
mushroom were well-cooked and perfectly satisfactory.</p>
<hr />
<p></p>
This restaurant, formerly So Go Café, has expanded north into the
storefront formerly occupied by Waloy Bakery 華來美食 in 67B East
Broadway. Business is still booming, and they now have a more serious
English menu than when they first opened. The number and arrangement of
seats finally seems adequate to a small restaurant. Clientele remains
overwhelmingly Fúzhōu.</p>
<p>Soft plastic Western-style spoons rather than the Chinese "boat spoon".
Pay at the cashier when you order and then take a seat; a waitress will
serve you.</p>
<hr />
<p></p>
They now open at 7:30 AM.</p>
