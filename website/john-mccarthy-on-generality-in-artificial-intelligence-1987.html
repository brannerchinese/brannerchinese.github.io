		<div><p>John McCarthy writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was obvious in 1971 and even in 1958 that AI programs suffered from
a lack of generality. It is still obvious, and now there are many more
details. The first gross symptom is that a small addition to the idea
of a program often involves a complete rewrite beginning with the data
structures. Some progress has been made in modularizing data
structures, but small modifications of the search strategies are even
less likely to be accomplished without rewriting.</p>
<p>Another symptom is that no-one knows how to make a general database of
common sense knowledge that could be used by any program that needed
the knowledge. Along with other information, such a database would
contain what a robot would need to know about the effects of moving
objects around, what a person can be expected to know about his
family, and the facts about buying and selling. This doesn't depend on
whether the knowledge is to be expressed in a logical language or in
some other formalism. When we take the logic approach to AI, lack of
generality shows up in that the axioms we devise to express common
sense knowledge are too restricted in their applicability for a
general common sense database. In my opinion, getting a language for
expressing general common sense knowledge for inclusion in a general
database is the key problem of generality in AI.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Production systems represent knowledge in the form of facts and rules,
and there is almost always a sharp syntactic distinction between the
two. The facts usually correspond to ground instances of logical
formulas, i.e. the correspond to predicate symbols applied to constant
expressions. Unlike logic-based systems, these facts contain no
variables or quantifiers. New facts are produced by inference,
observation and user input. Variables are reserved for rules, which
usually take a pattern-action form. Rules are put in the system by the
programmer or ``knowledge engineer'' and in most systems cannot
arise via the action of the system. In exchange for accepting these
limitations, the production system programmer gets a relatively fast
program.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>It seemed to me in 1958 that small modifications in behavior are most
often representable as small modifications in beliefs about the world,
and this requires a system that represents beliefs explicitly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>``If one wants a machine to be able to discover an abstraction, it
seems most likely that the machine must be able to represent this
abstraction in some relatively simple way'' (McCarthy 1959).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 1958 idea for increasing generality was to use logic to express
facts in a way independent of the way the facts might subsequently be
used. It seemed then and still seems that <strong>humans communicate mainly
in declarative sentences rather than in programming languages for good
objective reasons that will apply whether the communicator is a human,
a creature from Alpha Centauri or a computer program.</strong> Moreover, the
advantages of declarative information also apply to internal
representation. The advantage of declarative information is one of
generality. The fact that when two objects collide they make a noise
may be used in particular situations to make a noise, to avoid making
noise, to explain a noise or to explain the absence of noise. (I guess
those cars didn't collide, because while I heard the squeal of brakes,
I didn't hear a crash).</p>
<p>…</p>
<p><strong>Every increase in expressive power carries a price in the required
complexity of the reasoning and problem solving programs. To put it
another way, accepting limitations on the expressiveness of one's
declarative information allows simplification of the search
procedures.</strong> Prolog represents a local optimum in this continuum,
because Horn clauses are medium expressive but can be interpreted
directly by a logical problem solver.</p>
<p>One major limitation that is usually accepted is to limit the
derivation of new facts to formulas without variables, i.e to
substitute constants for variables and then do propositional
reasoning. It appears that most human daily activity involves only
such reasoning. In principle, Prolog goes slightly beyond this,
because the expressions found as values of variables by Prolog
programs can themselves involve free variables. However, this facility
is rarely used except for intermediate results.</p>
<p>What can't be done without more of predicate calculus than Prolog
allows is universal generalization.</p>

<p><a href="http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/generality.html">McCarthy's own notice</a> says, "Generality in Artificial Intelligence
relates to my ACM Turing Award lecture given in 1971. However, the ideas
didn't gell (sic) sufficiently at that time to be written up. In 1987
ACM asked for a summary to include in a volume of Turing Award lectures.
Instead I wrote this complete paper. Its actual relation to the 1971
lecture is hard to say." (accessed 20111026)</p></div>
