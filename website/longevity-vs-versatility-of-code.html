		<div><p>Until very recently, I have used HTML only as a simple markup language
for presenting static information. It was quite satisfactory for posting
announcements or writing, and easy to automate for formatting large
collections of material from my research databases. Even though the
databases might be updated daily, a given data dump was static as soon
as it was generated.</p>
<p>Now that I am trying to use HTML for interactive tasks, I can't avoid
facing its drawbacks any longer. One serious problem is that HTML is
"stateless" — commands take place without persistence of context, so you
either have to turn to cookies (of which many users are suspicious) or
supplement it with Javascript or other languages. Another problem is
that certain seemingly simple tasks have not been standardized (as of
HTML 4), so solutions vary by browser. An example that bothered me
recently was styling a "browse" button used for file upload. I've
identified a number of workarounds, but HTML 4 has no native way to do
this, and every workaround increases the risk of obsolescence or
outright failure in unplanned-for environments. As <a href="http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/personal.html">Jukka Korpela</a>
writes, ["The Browse button is particularly 'immune' to any
presentational suggestions; it's typically a 'hard-wired' part of the
browser's user interface."][] It's also dismaying how differently some
non-"web-safe" colors and background images appear when viewed in
different browsers.</p>
<p>I've gotten used to the incompatibilities between Python 2 and 3, which
fazed me at first. But everything connected with the web seems to be
subject to a higher margin of "not quite" than any compiled or scripting
language proper that I've seen.</p>
<p>The model of longevity in traditional scholarship — the world in which I
cut my teeth — assumes that what you produce in your 20s will still be
around and basically accessible when you're in your 70s, at least.
Mathematical writings from 120 years ago are still cited with some
frequency, and I possess philological books on the order of 1000 years
old that are still basically quite usable and remain in print for that
reason. I can even make my way around 1400-year old Chinese dictionary
manuscripts without too much pain. But the amount of tweaking needed to
keep code alive is a high trade-off for what I grant is its immense
flexibility.</p>
<p>At bottom, I think this is a difference in economic outlook: When I work
as a scholar, I labor to produce a description of something I can show
to be true, and to present it in such a way that my thinking can be
reproduced and challenged by anyone for a very long time to come. In
exchange, I am paid essentially nothing for what I hope is intellectual
substance of quality and intrinsic worth.</p>
<p>There is a different model of value involved in coding, and a different
time-frame.</p>
