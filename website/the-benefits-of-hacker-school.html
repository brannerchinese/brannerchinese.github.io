		<div><p>I spent three months this year in the Winter 2013 batch of <a href="http://hackerschool.com">Hacker
School</a>. Below are some thoughts on what it did for me, excerpted from
my feedback to the organization.</p>
<hr />
<p>Hacker School gave me a critical mass of people with whom I could
interact, having coding as the context of interaction. I have never had
that before.</p>
<p>The single most important outcome of this experience was my
acculturation as a programmer. I learned best practices, terms (both
standard and jargon), the names of companies and services, and more
generally how to think and express myself within this culture. For the
first time I came to think of myself as a programmer. I was so keyed up
during the batch that I slept about five hours a night, and I dreamt of
coding on most nights whose visions I can remember.</p>
<p>I have some sense now of the dimensions of the mind-space in which the
life of a coder is situated, as though I have become aware the height of
the unseen vaults overhead when I stand in a dark cathedral.</p>
<p>The community has provided me many models for how to do things and how
to conduct myself as a programmer. I finally overcame the sloth that had
previously kept me from learning how to use Git and VirtualEnv, and
those things have led to better workflow hygiene all around — it has led
me to pay much more attention to my Python and Ubuntu installations, for
instance. I finally remembered to begin making regular use of list and
dictionary comprehensions in my code, too.</p>
<p>Hacker School has provided far more chances for me to receive fruitful
criticism (Karl Popper's phrase) than I have ever gotten before on my
code or my thinking. The community is a sort of personal Stack Overflow,
without the insults or grubbing for votes, and that has been very
helpful. The use of [the internal chat client] Humbug [now renamed
<a href="zulip.com" title="Zulip">Zulip</a>, 20130813] greatly facilitated communication, including after
the batch, and think life would have been much harder if we had been
limited to IRC or Skype chat.</p>
<p>Other specific gains I'm aware of are, if not speed, then anyway "motor
memory" as it affects my proficiency with coding syntax and my choice of
tools. I have a long way to go yet but my progress these three months
has been greater than at any other time in my life as a coder. I have
become comfortable with SQLite3, BeautifulSoup4, Feedparser, and NLTK,
and am much more willing now to pick up a module I don't know and try to
learn how to use it. Now that the batch has been over for three weeks
and I am back to the insanity of my philological work — using chopsticks
to clear a room of swarms of gnats is what it's like — I constantly find
myself envisioning efficiencies and then building them or hunting for
tools rather than letting myself get into a rut doing things the same
way as before. That shows me that the grooves of my mind have indeed
been altered substantively by my experience these three months. I do not
feel quite right if several days go by without coding, either — I am
still making peace with that, as though after a religious experience
that demands changes in how I live.</p></div>
