		<div><p>I have been reading Elia Kazan's autobiography, <em>A Life</em>. Overall, I
like his brashness. But he insists a little too often that he is telling
the frank truth, whatever the cost, and that leaves me with a strong
impression of defensiveness. How often should someone who is telling the
truth sound defensive, after establishing at some point that the truth
is what he is going to tell? Kazan also tries to prevent the reader from
judging him by asserting that moral standards are mostly hollow and that
no one is any more honest than he (Kazan) is. That is a weak tactic,
familiar to me from conversations with bullies and manipulators over
many years: it can be effective against an individual, but not against
all readers in the abstract.</p>
<p>I grew up hearing that Kazan was a bad man who had betrayed his former
friends to HUAC. Much more recently, I saw documentary interviews with
Kazan and Budd Schulberg, both of whom said that since the Communists
and the McCarthyists were equally gangsters, how could there be any
question of taking sides with either one? That strikes me as basically
correct, whatever qualifications may be necessary. It's true that there
was a conspiracy to numb U.S. public opinion to the brutality of the
Soviet Union, and it's also true that Joseph McCarthy and the company
surrounding him were self-promoting bullies. Both camps were indeed
gangsters and unworthy of the allegiance of decent people. And beyond
that, it's true that for you or me to give expression to our
originality, we have to find ways to get free of the pressure that
bullies and manipulators can impose on us. That seems to be the core of
what Kazan and Schulberg were talking about, and it's a good point in
any era.</p>
<p>So I got interested in reading what Kazan has to say for himself more
broadly.</p>
<p>I was dismayed to find that self-righteous betrayal is indeed a big part
of his story â€” he was monumentally unfaithful to his wife and you can
see over and over again that he is ashamed of it, exactly because of his
many attempts to excuse it or neutralize the reader's disapproval.</p>

And then, after all, there is this, which dates from the actual
composition of the memoir. It refers to his testimony to a Congressional
committee against a former friend of his.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I thought what a terrible thing I'd done: not the political aspect of
it, because maybe that was correct, but it didn't matter now, correct
or not; all that mattered was the human side of the thing. I said to
myself, "You hurt another human being, a friend of yours and his
familiy, and no 'political aspect' matters two shits." (Elia Kazan, <em>A
Life</em>, [N.p.: Da Capo Press, 1997], p. 685)</p>
