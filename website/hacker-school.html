		<div><p>I have now had one-on-one meetings with six of my Hacker School
"batchlings" — brothers and sisters in the impending batch — to begin
building personal relationships before the madness of meeting 50 new
people all at once, which starts in three days. Establishing individual
edges ahead of time seems a useful preparation for learning the whole
order(2\^6) graph at once.</p>
<p>A returning member of batch[4] invited us to meet at Union Hall, a bar
in Brooklyn. It was a longish trek for me and I couldn't set out until I
had finished with the course I am teaching. But I did get there, and
after the usual unpleasantness trying to interact in a dark place with
noise all around, the group of perhaps eight or ten of us settled in a
quieter nook. Then it was possible to have mostly audible conversations
and even to see the expressions of the people who were speaking.</p>
<p>I'm impressed at how interesting and pleasant everyone seems to be. And
I got home well after three. Very glad I went — eight to ten people is
still a manageable number to meet at one time.</p></div>
