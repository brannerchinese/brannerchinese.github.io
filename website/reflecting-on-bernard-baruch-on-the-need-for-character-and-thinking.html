		<div><p>During the late Spring of 2012 I was asked to comment on a remark of
Bernard Baruch (1870–1965):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"During my eighty-seven years I have witnessed a whole succession of
technological revolutions. But none of them has done away with the
need for character in the individual or the ability to think." Here is
what I said:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree with Baruch. Certainly no tool is more reliable than the hand
that uses it. We witness spectacular miscalculations in the management
of sophisticated technology — nuclear plants breached by earthquakes,
wars launched for shifting reasons and with immense collateral death
tolls, the sudden collapse of economic structures. We ourselves cause
these events to become disasters, by putting faith in tools and
mechanisms without cultivating sufficient skill and judgment to manage
them. Naturally so; tools tend to fail at “edge cases”, and edge cases
are often hard to plan for. The situation is just as Baruch says, but I
suggest that “character and the ability to think” are themselves
actually a kind of technology, to be developed and propagated.</p>
<p>I share Baruch’s pessimism about viewing every new technology in
messianic terms; in fact, I think the problems of human existence remain
surprisingly alike over time. Granted, our tools for use against those
problems have improved enormously, but we remain plagued by basic
issues: slavery, hunger, hatred, theft, betrayal of trust, and so on.
Consider the suffering caused by preventable diseases. According to the
WHO, for instance, easily curable pneumonia and diarrhea still kill well
over two million children every year.* No one, however greedy or
unfeeling, can think the death of two million children a year from
diarrhea is insignificant, and yet somehow humankind does not seem able
to prevent it decisively.</p>
<p>Where Baruch’s incisive apothegm does not cut deeply enough is in
showing the reach of “character and thinking.” To set against the
diarrhea problem we already have effective tools and people with the
necessary character and ability to think, but we fail to concentrate our
collective will so that the problem actually gets and stays solved.
Apparently humankind needs a mechanism for forcing decisive action that
we all agree is desirable. The real source of our failure to solve
problems like death from diarrhea is narrow self-interest, something
deeply seated in human nature. Some of the effects of self-interest are
valuable, so learning to control it intelligently is the most crucial
domain of character and thinking.</p>
<p>Like Baruch, I want to make change in the world using my gifts. As a
professor, I am in a position of power from which to promote a moderate
altruism in my students, at least among themselves, through my own
example. I try to be generous toward them with my time; I grade in such
a way as to encourage responsible collaboration; I try to speak my mind
peaceably in case of differences of opinion; I try not to hide the
mistakes I make in our subject; and so on. I tell students that,
whatever their politics, they belong to the world’s elite by virtue of
the education they have received. Above all, I require them to help each
other.</p>
<p>I do not know whether doing those things myself really motivates my
students to practice the same behavior. But I act on the premise that
“character and thinking,” though costly to cultivate and at times a
nuisance to use in those edge cases where technology fails us, are
humankind’s most powerful tools. As tools, then, they are something not
different from “technology” and can be propagated. Displaying their
effectiveness through my own example is, I hope, part of a technology
revolution whose potential Bernard Baruch would not dismiss.</p>
