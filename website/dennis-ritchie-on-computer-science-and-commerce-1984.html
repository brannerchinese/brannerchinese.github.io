<blockquote>
<p><strong>More than anything else, the greatest danger to good computer
science research today may be <em>excessive</em> relevance.</strong> Evidence for
the worldwide fascination with computers is everywhere, from the
articles on the financial, and even the front pages of the newspapers,
to the difficulties that even the most prestigious universities
experience in finding and keeping faculty in computer science. The
best professors, instead of teaching bright students, join start-up
companies, and often discover that their brightest students have
preceded them. Computer science is in the limelight, especially those
aspects, such as systems, languages, and machine architecture, that
may have immediate commercial applications. The attention is
flattering, but it can work to the detriment of good research.</p>
<p>As the intensity of research in a particular area increases, so does
the impulse to keep its results secret. This is true even in the
university … although in academia there is a strong counterpressure:
Unless one publishes, one never becomes known at all. In industry, a
natural impulse of the establishment is to guard proprietary
information. Researchers understand reasonable restrictions on what
and when they publish, but many will become irritated and flee
elsewhere, or start working in less delicate areas, if prevented from
communicating their discoveries and inventions in suitable fashion. …</p>
<p>Another danger is that commercial pressures of one sort or another
will divert the attention of the best thinkers from real innovation to
exploitation of the current fad, from prospecting to mining a known
lode. These pressures manifest themselves not only in the
disappearance of faculty into industry, but also in the conservatism
that overtakes those with well-paying investments — intellectual or
financial — in a given idea. Perhaps this effect explains why so few
interesting software systems have come from the large computer
companies; they are locked into the existing world. …</p>
<p><p>
Partly because they are new and still immature, and partly because
they are a creation of the intellect, the arts and sciences of
software abridge the chain, usual in physics and engineering, between
fundamental discoveries, advanced development, and application. The
inventors of ideas about how software should work usually find it
necessary to build demonstration systems. For large systems, and for
revolutionary ideas, much time is required: It can be said that UNIX
was written in the 70s to distill the best systems ideas of the 60s,
and became the commonplace of the 80s. …</p>
