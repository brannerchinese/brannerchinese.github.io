		<div><p>My sixth router this year has died — no amount of hard resetting will
revive it — it was a highly rated Asus RT-N56U, four months old. Before
that I had a series of four MediaLink MWN-WAPR150Ns — the company sent
me three replacements in succession, but none of them worked properly —
and before that I had a Linksys WRT400N that failed a week after the
warranty ran out. MediaLink worked hard to help me, and in the end I
didn't ask them for my money back. But I'm not going to try them again
soon.</p>
<p>What makes routers die so quickly? Is it my bad conscience, after all?
More likely, bad capacitors and air circulation. I can improve the
latter a little (open the case, leave open space under it, even aim a
low-power fan at it) but not the former. Bad capacitors even undermine
my willingness to pay for a more expensive and possibly better piece of
equipment, since I suspect the manufacturer may still be using the same
cheap parts. I swoon at the thought of a Peplink Balance, but I doubt I
can justify the cost, and for only four ports.</p>
<p>I've managed to get one computer connected directly to my modem (shields
up, Mr. Sulu) with an ethernet cable some five times as long as I am
tall. There are cables everywhere in my life now — it is beginning to
look as though I live in the movie Brazil.</p>
<p>Worse than the cables, and worse even than the expense of buying
hardware that fails so quickly, is the waste of time as I try to track
down the problems.</p></div>
