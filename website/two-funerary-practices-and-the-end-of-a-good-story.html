		<div><p>I was not able to attend my Uncle Barney's funeral over the summer and
just saw one of the obituaries (<a href="http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/theday/obituary.aspx?n=bernard-donald-branner-barney&amp;pid=153058951">reposted at legacy.com</a> from an
original in <a href="https://www.theday.com/">The Day of New London</a>), which mentions a "final toast
and raspberry cheer".</p>
<p>I had not heard of this custom before, but apparently his friends and
loving children sent him off with what is also known as a Bronx cheer.
(He was born in the Bronx.) That would not have been out of character
for him as a last request.</p>
<p>Yesterday, his closest youngsters went out in a boat and took turns
ladling his ashes — mixed with those of my aunt Julie from 17 years ago
— into the Niantic River a few hundred feet from what was once the
family home. My cupful of ashes contained a good proportion of bone
fragments. There is still a lot of junk in his house to be disposed of,
as well as the house itself, but that burden has not fallen to me. So
yesterday's little ceremony on the water was, for me, a most
satisfactory farewell.</p>
<p>My uncle tried all his life to write "the Great American Novel", an
ambition for which his many gifts — chiefly working with his hands — did
not qualify him.</p>
<p>Barney met Aunt Julie when he was 16 and they were both smitten. Family
pressures separated them, and they married other people. But on his
return from the Korean war he found her single and courted her again,
divorced his wife, and at age 32 finally married her. Seeing the family
home yesterday, my grandfather's retirement home and the place where
Barney and Julie lived for the first 20 years or so of their marriage, I
see that my uncle's real novel was his happy life with Julie, an honest
love story of the sort you don't often encounter. The last line of that
romance was apparently written on the Niantic yesterday morning.</p></div>
