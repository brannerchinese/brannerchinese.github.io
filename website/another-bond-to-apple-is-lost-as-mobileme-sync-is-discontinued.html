		<div><p>Since Apple will stop supporting MobileMe Sync at the end of this month,
at least for some of the operating systems still in contented use in our
household, I have had to look for replacements for the datebook and
address-book software. Apple's new services are intended to manage my
recordings for me, something I regard as an offensive intrusion into my
research life, since I still use iTunes for thousands of original
recordings connected to my fieldwork and my study of accented Mandarin.
One more bond to Apple, which I began using in 1985 and at one time
adored, is about to break.</p>
<p>For the datebook, it is not difficult to make use of Google's calendar,
whose API now conveniently supports many laptop and mobile applications
— an earlier updating conflict with Apple's iCal was resolved a year or
more ago. I have now settled on Mozilla's Thunderbird — not for the mail
service but for the calendar alone — and found it easy to make the
transition from iCal.</p>
<p>I am also going to have to find a replacement for Apple's address book,
but in this case I don't want to use Google, since Google immediately
does things with Apple address book information — among other things, it
deletes all the notes, and combines the incoming entries with what is
already in my gmail account, and tries to "help" me in ways that just
cost me time to undo manually. It may be that I have to pay for a
separate service like Zimbra, though a more interesting prospect is to
set up my own contacts database on my own server and access the
information that way.</p></div>
