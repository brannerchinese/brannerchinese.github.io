		<div><p>For two weeks, I have experimented with creatine, a non-essential
nutrient widely used by athletes to build muscle mass. I have no
interest in muscle mass, but was interested in reports of improvements
to cognition and memory in certain circumstances — something that has
begun to interest me keenly as I try to manage my time and shepherd my
attention in order to learn mathematics as well as I can. I have
achieved pretty dense technical expertise in Chinese and related areas,
but math is harder for me than anything else I have ever studied. On the
other hand, creatine's effects on cognition and memory are documented
mainly for people with impaired cognitive ability due to age, illness,
diet, or exhaustion. Only the last of these might conceivably apply to
me in my present life, and I am not aware of any cognitive deficit — in
fact, I seem to get a lot more done than most people I know.</p>
<hr />
<p></p>
<strong>Creatine</strong>. Creatine is synthesized in the human body from amino acids
and can be fully absorbed for at least the first several months of use,
after which its effects seem to drop off. There seem to be no known
dangers to its use in my circumstances. The creatine I took was from
Twinlabs, which says that it buys the raw ingredient from laboratories
in Germany and China, and tests and packages it in the US.</p>
<p><strong>Dosage</strong>. For ten days, I took 3.6 g of creatine monohydrate twice a
day, together with vitamin B and C and some simple carbohydrates. These
doses are typical of those in medical experiments and are at the low end
of what is apparently common in use by athletes, for whom doses of
20-30g/day are not unusual. For the following four days I took no
creatine at all but continued the vitamin B and C.</p>
<p><strong>Effects</strong>. I noticed a very marked increase in the energy I felt,
especially when exercising — when walking fast on New York streets (the
so-called Gotham Breakneck) and on an elliptical machine. I would
describe my mood as somewhat more excited than usual, but not to the
point of being jumpy or jittery. When walking, I felt quite a surge of
power — so much that at first I thought I ought to be careful lest I
inadvertently bump into someone. For the elliptical machine, I can offer
an actual measurement, since the machine I use measures the energy
needed to resist the flywheel's rotation and reports that as a number of
calories. During the ten days of creatine use, I averaged 940
calories/hour of exercise. In the previous eight weeks, without any
creatine use, I averaged 902 calories/hour. The increase was about 4%
over my recent level — nothing spectacular, even if significant. Over
the past two years I have averaged 924±70 calories/hour on the same
machine.</p>
<p>Anecdotally, I noticed some increase in libido and food-cravings (though
not overall appetite). Both may be attributable to the feeling of
excitement I described above. Apart from that sensation, I noticed no
changes in my overall range of moods. My sleep was noticeably sounder
than usual. In my normal life without creatine, unless I have had a
minimum of 80 minutes of strenuous exercise during the previous day, I
typically wake up at night after 3-4 hours and have to force myself to
sleep again, often by reading or writing. I think this is the effect of
stress, which exercise relieves very palpably. During the period of
creatine use I slept at least 6 and half hours every night and do not
recall waking after 3-4 hours, even though I got the same amount of
strenuous exercise I normally do — which is to say about 45 minutes a
day, plus the modest effects of working at a standing desk for most of
my work day and a small amount (30 minutes or less) of Gotham Breakneck
walking. I typically take at least one short (10-20 minute) nap during
the day, and also did so on the days when I was taking creatine.</p>
<p>There have been reports of dyspepsia or water retention with creatine
use in controlled conditions, but I noticed none. All my bodily and
mental functions appeared normal to me, except for the few items
described above: mild but persistent excitement, considerable power when
exercising, more energy during the day, mildly increased libido and
food-cravings, sounder sleep without waking.</p>
<p>Most importantly, I noticed no improvement in my ability to get through
hard intellectual problems, to prioritize tasks, to recall facts, or to
concentrate generally. In fact, since each dose of creatine was followed
by several hours of comparative excitement, I think the state of my mind
for study was slightly less than ideal.</p>
<p>After ending the use of creatine, I felt completely normal beginning on
the very first day — my levels of energy and attention seemed normal to
me. My ability to concentrate on difficult ideas was no worse than when
I was taking creatine.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions</strong>:</p>
<p>First, that <strong>creatine seems to be effective for increasing one's energy
level</strong>, especially for physical exercise. If I find myself tired or
under heavy stress, I may take small doses again for a limited period of
time.</p>
<p>Second, that <strong>creatine is of no use to me as a study aid</strong>. I had
considered that patience and concentration are matters of
time-management, which is a matter of discipline, which can be thought
of as a matter of strength and stamina — and that creatine would help
with the first step in this chain, that of strength and stamina. But I
now see very much more clearly that patience is a consequence of the
reflexive application of patience itself, and that the increase in
physical energy brought about by creatine is actually a hindrance (say,
a small one) to the cultivation and practice of patience.</p>
<hr />
<p></p>
<strong>Readings</strong>:</p>
<p>Below are interesting extracts from the abstracts of about two dozen
articles I examined while researching creatine. They should not be read
out of context; the best thing would be to look up the original articles
and read the abstracts completely and then try to understand as much of
the original articles as one can in a reasonable amount of time. I spent
a number of hours reading the materials and taking the notes below.</p>
<p><strong>Cognition and Memory</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Following 24-h sleep deprivation, creatine supplementation had a
    positive effect on mood state and tasks that place a heavy stress on
    the prefrontal cortex. McMorris et al., 2006a.</li>
<li>Creatine supplementation aids cognition in the elderly. McMorris et
    al., 2007a.</li>
<li>Creatine supplementation only improves cognitive processing and
    psychomotor performance in individuals who have impaired cognitive
    processing abilities. Rawson et al., 2008.</li>
<li>Creatine seems to be totally absorbed since no creatine or
    creatinine was detectable in feces. Ingestion of creatine combined
    with BG facilitates its retention by slowing down its absorption
    rate and reducing its urinary excretion. Deldicque et al., 2008.</li>
<li>During sleep deprivation with moderate-intensity exercise, creatine
    supplementation only affects performance of complex central
    executive tasks. McMorris et al., 2007b.</li>
<li>In vegetarians rather than in those who consume meat, creatine
    supplementation resulted in better memory. Irrespective of dietary
    style, the supplementation of creatine decreased the variability in
    the responses to a choice reaction-time task. Benton et al., 2011</li>
<li>The median healthy life span of Cr-fed mice was 9% higher than in
    control mice, and they performed significantly better in
    neurobehavioral tests. In brains of Cr-treated mice, there was a
    trend towards a reduction of reactive oxygen species and
    significantly lower accumulation of the "aging pigment" lipofuscin.
    Bender et al., 2008.</li>
<li>After taking the creatine supplement, task-evoked increase of
    cerebral oxygenated hemoglobin in the brains of subjects measured by
    near infrared spectroscopy was significantly reduced, which is
    compatible with increased oxygen utilization in the brain. Watanabe
    et al., 2002.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<strong>Habituation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Recent findings in healthy humans indicate that the beneficial
    effect on muscle function and muscle total creatine content may
    disappear when creatine is continuously ingested for more than two
    or three months. The mechanism for this habituation to chronic
    creatine exposure is poorly understood. (Derave et al. 2003) [DPB:
    Full text was not available.]</li>
<li>Withdrawal from Cr had no effect on the rate of strength, endurance,
    and loss of lean tissue mass with 12 weeks of reduced-volume
    training. (Candow et al., 2004). [DPB: in other words, after
    cesssation of creatine, its lingering effect on strength, endurance,
    and loss of lean tissue mass is indistinguishable from not having
    taken it at all.]</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<strong>Safety</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We advise that high-dose (>3-5 g/day) creatine supplementation
    should not be used by individuals with pre-existing renal disease or
    those with a potential risk for renal dysfunction (diabetes,
    hypertension, reduced glomerular filtration rate). A
    pre-supplementation investigation of kidney function might be
    considered for reasons of safety, but in normal healthy subjects
    appears unnecessary. Kim et al., 2011.</li>
<li>There is little to no evidence that any of the newer forms of
    creatine are more effective and/or safer than CM whether ingested
    alone and/or in combination with other nutrients. Jäger et al.,
    2011.</li>
<li>Short-term Cr supplementation appears to be safe but does not
    enhance push-up performance. Armentano et al., 2007.</li>
<li>To date, studies have not found clinically significant deviations
    from normal values in renal, hepatic, cardiac or muscle function.
    Few data are available on the long-term consequences of creatine
    supplementation. Perskey et al., 2007.</li>
<li>Under conditions that exist the human stomach (high acidity and
    supply of nitrite from food and saliva), creatine can react to form
    N-nitrososarcosine that is known to induce esophageal cancer in rats
    and stomach cancer in mice. Archer, 2004.</li>
<li>Main side effects were gastrointestinal complaints. Although serum
    creatinine levels increased in Cr patients because of the
    degradation of Cr, all other markers of tubular or glomerular renal
    function, especially cystatin C, remained normal, indicating
    unaltered kidney function. Bender et al., 2008.</li>
<li>While creatine may enhance the performance of high-intensity,
    short-duration exercise, it is not useful in endurance sports.
    Because commercially marketed creatine products do not meet the same
    quality control standards of pharmaceuticals, there is always a
    concern of impurities or doses higher or lower than those on the
    labeling. Graham et al., 1999.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<strong>Caffeine and Creatine</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>High combined doses of creatine and caffeine does not affect the LBM
    composition of either sedentary or exercised rats, however, caffeine
    supplementation alone reduces the percentage of fat. Vertical
    jumping training increases the percentages of water and protein and
    reduces the fat percentage in rats. Franco et al., 2011.</li>
<li>Caffeine ingestion after creatine supplements augmented intermittent
    high-intensity sprint performance. Lee et al. 2011.</li>
<li>Although caffeine and creatine appear to be ergogenic aids, they do
    so in a sport-specific context and there is no rationale for their
    simultaneous use in sport. Higher doses of caffeine can be toxic and
    appear to be ergolytic. There is no rationale for creatine doses in
    excess of the recommendations, and some athletes can get stomach
    upset, especially at higher creatine doses. Tarnopolsky, 2011.</li>
<li>These findings suggest that the acute ingestion of this preexercise
    supplement ["containing caffeine, creatine, and amino acids"] may be
    an effective strategy for improving anaerobic performance, but
    appears to have no effect on aerobic power. Fukuda et al., 2010.</li>
<li>Improvements in VO2max, [critical velocity], and [lean body mass]
    when GT ["proprietary blend including whey protein, cordyceps
    sinensis, creatine, citrulline, ginseng, and caffeine"] is combined
    with HIIT ["high-intensity interval training"]. Three weeks of HIIT
    alone also augmented anaerobic running performance, VO2max and body
    composition. Smith, et al, 2010.</li>
<li>As indicated by a greater T(lim), acute caffeine ingestion was found
    to be ergogenic [New Oxford American Dictionary, version bundled
    with Mac OS 10.5.8: "intended to enhance physical performance,
    stamina, or recovery"] after 6-d of creatine supplementation and
    caffeine abstinence. Doherty et al., 2002.</li>
<li>It is concluded that Caf intake (3 days) prolongs muscle RT
    [relaxation time] and by this action overrides the shortening of RT
    due to creatine supplementation. Hespel et al., 2003.</li>
<li>Caffeine pharmacokinetics were not affected by concomitant
    administration of creatine or by physical exercise. In conclusion,
    neither maximal performance and subsequent recovery nor aerobic
    performance were enhanced by oral creatine supplementation in the
    study. Vanakosky, et al., 1998.</li>
<li>The data show that Cr supplementation elevates muscle PCr
    concentration and markedly improves performance during intense
    intermittent exercise. This ergogenic effect, however, is completely
    eliminated by caffeine intake. Vandenberghe et al., 1996.</li>
