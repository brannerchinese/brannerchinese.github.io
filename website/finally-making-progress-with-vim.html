		<div><p>Now that the semester is over, I am finally in the mood to risk using
the text editor Vim for various tasks that are important to me, and so
to have a chance to learn the thing for real.</p>
<p>Vim enthusiasts often mention the lack of hand movement as one of the
attractions of this tool. I am not attracted by that, though. I prefer a
certain amount of bodily entropy when studying, and the arm movements of
typing are part of that. And I value the kind of memory that comes from
involving my body in thinking. That is why I use standing desks (various
home-made ones â€” I'm unwilling to pay the exorbitant prices demanded in
the marketplace). That is why I still use paper books, whose physical
shape serves as a guide to my recollection of what I've read. The
minimal hand- and arm-movements needed for Vim are helpful to
touch-typing, but I don't place great store by them in themselves.</p>
<p>What I am really enjoying about Vim today is the need to think, even to
calculate a little before doing anything other than actually typing
text. It reminds me of learning to use a scythe when I was about 14.
Naturally, my inclination was just to slash at the grass. But an adult
watching me, one Pierce Skinner, came over and suggested that I pause
for half a second before each swing of the scythe, to consider what I
was about to do. My scything improved enormously and the act of
fore-thinking felt very good. I am experiencing something similar right
now with Vim and enjoying it.</p>

I see Pierce Skinner is now a practicing clinical psychologist in New
Jersey.</p></div>
