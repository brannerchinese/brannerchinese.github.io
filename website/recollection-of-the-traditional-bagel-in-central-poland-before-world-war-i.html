		<div><p>My grandfather Maurice Prager (1902–1992) said that in his boyhood in
the city of Przasnysz, Poland, bagels were only made by private people
for sale on the street, not by bakeries, which dealt in bread, nor by
pastry shops. The food economy in that place and time was different from
our own — far more of it was in the hands of non-professionals (though
my grandfather knew something of the professional food industry because
he was close to his uncle, a miller).</p>
<p>As he described them to me, the bagels consisted of thin double strands
of dough braided in a circular spiral, and unlike the almost-holeless
variety we see in New York today they had much more hole than bread. So
far from being chewy or gummy, which define the range of consistency in
New York today, these were extremely tough. They were made of white
flour and did not have any other flavorings, neither seeds nor bulbs,
and forget blueberries or chocolate.</p>
<p>My thought is that they must have had more in common with a traditional
German soft pretzel (though boiled before baking rather than treated
with lye) than with either the Montréal or New York bagel.</p>
