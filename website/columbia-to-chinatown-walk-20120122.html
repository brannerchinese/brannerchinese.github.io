		<div><p>For the first time since the spring I walked to Chinatown from home. In
the past this has been my favorite form of exercise, and I think I have
felt healthiest when doing it regularly. Although the number of calories
I burn per hour isn't comparable to what I can do on an elliptical
machine, it is a longer course of exercise than I ever do on a machine
and there is a strong meditative component to it. Above all, the "music
of the city street" succors me like nothing else.</p>
<p>I got up at 7:45, enough time to leave at 8:00 and be on East Broadway
by 10:30, after a leisurely walk along the river. East Broadway is far
enough east that a little extra time has to be left beyond simply
reaching Canal St. on the West Side. But I looked out the window at the
frozen slush and couldn't motivate myself to go out the door. A proper
morning walk is easiest if you start immediately on rising, without
thinking. I let the moment pass and decided to take the train at 9:30.</p>
<p>But at 8:20 I was already feeling regrets. On the principle that
whatever I don't feel like doing is precisely what I should do, I got my
shoes on and was on the road at 8:31. Rather than follow the river, I
took a different route, also slower than necessary, heading to the East
Side through Central Park first. Normally I would follow Broadway, the
most time-efficient path because Broadway cuts gently eastward at a
diagonal through the grid, imposing its humanity on the bureaucratic
structure. I was sure I'd be late. But to my great surprise I arrived at
10:32, essentially in perfect time. I admit I pushed myself to take
longer and faster strides than usual because I didn't want to leave my
food-partner waiting, and so I ran for about three of the blocks. I also
lost my willpower at one moment near the end and hailed a passing #15
bus. But the bus driver ignored me, and I found my own drive fully
refreshed by the slight.</p>

Discomforts of the walk to Chinatown from Columbia:</p>
<ul>
<li>On the <strong>Broadway route</strong> it is stressful facing the "uncity" hordes
    in Times Square. This has gotten worse since the area was closed to
    traffic. I can deal with cars much better than with tourists — in
    the old days, my method was to walk in the street at the edge of the
    traffic, basically a safe and happy between-space for me. But now
    there are no cars and the best idea is to head east around the
    pedestrian-only area. I'm technically a pedestrian, but then again
    not exactly.</li>
<li>The <strong>river route</strong> brings you into conflict with bicyclists, while
    all the far West Side routes (10th Avenue and west) put you at the
    mercy of uncity drivers who think they are on a highway rather than
    in New York.</li>
<li>On the <strong>East Side</strong>, on weekends one encounters dog walkers who,
    though not uncity in the formal sense, seem to dwell in a subjective
    suburb all the same, unaware that their long leashes are a dangerous
    obstacle to people like me because their whole attention is on the
    sound in their headphones. On weekdays there are many commuters on
    the street — angrier with the world, it seems to me, on the East
    Side than on the West.</li>
