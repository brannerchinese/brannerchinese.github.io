		<div><p>Max Weber, in "Science as a Vocation":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Only by strict specialization can the scientific worker become fully
conscious, for once and perhaps never again in his lifetime, that he
has achieved something that will endure. A really definitive and good
accomplishment is today always a specialized accomplishment. And
whoever lacks the capacity to put on blinders, so to speak, and to
come up to the idea that the fate of his soul depends upon whether or
not he makes the correct conjecture at this passage of this manuscript
may as well stay away from science. He will never have what one may
call the 'personal experience' of science. Without this strange
intoxication, ridiculed by every outsider; without this passion, this
'thousands of years must pass before you enter into life and thousands
more wait in silence' — according to whether or not you succeed in
making this conjecture; without this, you have no calling for science
and you should do something else. For nothing is worthy of man as man
unless he can pursue it with passionate devotion.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Why does one engage in doing something that in reality never comes,
and never can come, to an end?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>[To] set to work and meet the 'demands of the day,' in human relations
as well as in our vocation … is plain and simple, if each finds and
obeys the demon who holds the fibers of his very life.</p>
