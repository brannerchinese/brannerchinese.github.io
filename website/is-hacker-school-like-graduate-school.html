		<div><p>I go on reflecting on the difference between my City College experience
and what is happening to me at Hacker School. Seven of Hacker School's
twelve weeks are up.</p>
<p>Is Hacker School like graduate school? Well, it is not like a computer
science graduate program, because the emphasis is entirely on coding.
But it reminds me of an element of my time as a graduate student of East
Asian Studies in Seattle: particularly the close relationships that came
into being among the students in the rigorous sinology part of the
program. We studied together, crammed together, shared notes on how to
deal with various faculty, learned how to attend conferences, read each
other's work, and sat in on each other's dissertation defenses.</p>
<p>There was not nearly so much closeness among the students of Chinese
linguistics proper, perhaps because there were fewer of us and
especially there were fewer really serious students among us. But among
the sinologists proper there has been a sense of clan-membership that
has lasted ever since those days.</p>
<p>That is a basic part of what graduate education ought to be â€” the
establishment of life-long relationships with other people in one's
field, as all of them make their peace with the culture of that field.</p>
<p>I have the sensation that that is what is underway at Hacker School,
too.</p></div>
