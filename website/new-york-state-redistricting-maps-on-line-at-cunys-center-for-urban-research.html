You have a different Congressman now but no one thought you needed toÂ know.">I wrote six weeks ago</a> about my strange experience trying to vote in
the New York primary election. Election workers told people in my
building that we had been moved to a different district and so were not
eligible to vote, even though none of us had been notified of the
change.</p>
<p>Letters to a number of elected officials, asking for information, went
unanswered. [The New York City Board of Election website only shows
State districts (accessed 20120807)][]. [The website of the U.S. House
of Representatives only shows the current (pre-redistricting) district
borders (accessed 20120807)][]. The Board of Election customer service
phone line is constantly busy and I haven't been able to get through,
and the City Public Advocate's office is the same way.</p>
<p>Finally I called Daniel O'Donnell, my state representative. Within five
minutes his office found me a [<strong>good source for maps showing the
redistricting: the CUNY Mapping Service at the Center for Urban
Research</strong>][] (accessed 20120807). These maps are not official; <a href="http://latfor.state.ny.us/maps/">there
is official information at "LATFOR"</a>, a State legislative task force
on redistricting, but those maps are not clear enough to show
building-by-building boundaries.</p>
