		<div><p>A correspondent bemoaned the ubiquity of cell phones and laptops — they
seemed cooler, he said, when he was the only one who had one.</p>
<p>But I can offer three reasons why the technically inclined should not
feel their elitism to be wounded:</p>
<ol>
<li>Now that there are so many smartphones everywhere, street and subway
    are much quieter overall than they were when all most people had
    were simple cellphones. That's good for me; it improves my living
    and working environment.
    </p>
    <p></li>
<li>People are also increasingly absorbed in their
    dopamine-stimulators* and therefore less likely to get in my way or
    otherwise annoy me. They move more slowly and are less likely to
    notice when I push ahead of them.
    </p>
    <p></li>
<li>Most people looking at the smartphones are listening to music,
    watching videos, playing games, or reading texts — all things that
    are much less intellect-intensive than what I use computers for. So
    there's still plenty of opportunity for techno-elitism.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<hr />

*In Wim Wenders' 1991 movie "Until the End of the World", among many
trenchant memes, there was a little hand-held machine that people could
use to record and then review their dreams. People were shown walking
around all day looking into the machine, unable to do much else. It now
seems prophetic.</p></div>
