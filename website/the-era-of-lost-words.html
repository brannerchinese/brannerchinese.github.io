		<div><p>A letter to my mother from an art publisher in the U.K. this morning
mentions "the collapse of orders from the American academic market."
After 12 years in the making, our collection of my father's early and
little-known papers (on which my mother and a student of my father's
have been working interminably) is going to be looking for a new venue.
My mother is still determined to issue it in physical form.</p>
<p>In a conversation in July with a major academic publisher, I was told
that this year, for the first time, library orders of PDFs have
outstripped orders of physical books.</p>
<p>Electronic publication is very convenient, but I'm sure I'm not the only
person who has reservations about this development. Issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Persistence</strong>. One of my scholarly fields involves manuscripts a
    thousand and more years old. Over the years, I've bought a couple of
    dozen editions of reproductions of these things, some with copious
    commentary and corrigenda. I'm happy at the prospect of more people
    being able to access these things in electronic format. But it
    occurs to me that these manuscripts have only survived because they
    were in physical form. I can imagine much of the written creation of
    our present day — which is disseminated far more widely than ever in
    the past — disappearing without a trace because most of it exists
    only in a state that is transient and much less stable than print
    (or inscription on stone steles).</li>
<li><strong>Preparation</strong>. Flat text and images are easy to prepare for
    electronic publication and can be printed into the form of a
    physical book with almost no trouble on the user's part.
    Dictionaries, however, have to be organized as structured data in
    order to be useful, and that requires more complicated computational
    treatment.</li>
</ul>
