		<div><p>I <a href="http://brannerchinese.wordpress.com/2013/09/15/tense-in-git-commit-messages/" title="Tense in Git commit messages">wrote earlier about grammatical tense in Git commits</a>, but have
been thinking more about it today. My inclination has always been to
make a commit message a description of my own actions in relation to my
code or the state of the project:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>updated database</p>
<p>fixed all remaining bugs; README still skimpy</p>
<p>refactored main() to find &amp; use most current dump</p>
<p>etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But as I described in the earlier post, I was surprised to find that
there is widespread and competing advocacy of the principle that we
should write in either present tense or imperative mood.</p>
<p>Present tense and imperative mood are not the same thing, and if you
read actual examples from around the Web, you quickly find that
prescriptions and implementation of commit-grammar vary quite a bit.
GitHub seems to advocate using present or simple past tense:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you make a commit in a non-default branch with the "Fixes #33"
syntax, the issue is referenced with a tooltip.</p>
<p>You can use any of the following keywords to close an issue via commit
message:</p>
<ul>
<li>close</li>
<li>closes</li>
<li>closed</li>
<li>fix</li>
<li>fixes</li>
<li>fixed</li>
<li>resolve</li>
<li>resolves</li>
<li>resolved</li>
</ul>
<p>(<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages">https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages</a>;
cf. [http://gitref.org/basic/#commit][], which does not discuss
issues of grammar at all; both accessed 20131018)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Drupal advocates past tense:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Usually, commit messages start with the (past tense) verb</p>
<ul>
<li>"Added" (new feature)</li>
<li>"Fixed" (bug fix)</li>
<li>"Changed" (task)</li>
<li>"Updated" (task, due to changes in third-party code)</li>
</ul>
<p>It may not be trivial to phrase a summary starting with one of those
verbs. But if used consistently, you will get used to it. When not
using these verbs, make sure you prefix the commit message with the
issue category. (<a href="https://drupal.org/node/52287">https://drupal.org/node/52287</a>, accessed 20131018)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Erlang advocates using a command:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write the summary line and description of what you have done in the
imperative mode, that is as if you were commanding someone. Write
“fix”, “add”, “change” instead of “fixed”, “added”, “changed”.
(<a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/wiki/Writing-good-commit-messages">https://github.com/erlang/otp/wiki/Writing-good-commit-messages</a>,
accessed 20131018)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Python officially prescribes using commands:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The docstring is a phrase ending in a period. It prescribes the
function or method's effect as a command ("Do this", "Return that"),
not as a description; e.g. don't write "Returns the pathname ...".
(<a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257">http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257</a>, by David Goodger and Guido
van Rossum, accessed 20131018)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't see prescriptions for <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html#commit-your-changes">Ruby</a>, Java, or C++. The <a href="http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Style-of-Change-Logs.html#Style-of-Change-Logs">discussion of
GNU change-log style</a> doesn't seem to have any English syntax in mind.</p>
<p>The Erlang and Python model is so strange, and so insistent about
avoiding the more natural practice of simple description, that it
requires adding some energy in order to understand what is going on.</p>
<hr />
<p>What makes the use of a command in a commit-message or docstring
unsettling is trying to see how it relates to the use of the commit or
function it goes with. (A commit can be understood as a kind of function
acting on one's repository, so from now on I'll refer only to functions
and docstrings.) A command implies direction, instruction, exhortation,
or persuasion. As a matter of grammar, imperative mood takes a number of
forms — the second person ("you") form is most familiar in English,
where the speaker tells the hearer or reader what to do:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Go away!</p>
<p>Give that grain of rice back back to the farmer you got it from at
once.</p>
<p>Don't even think about parking here.</p>
<p>etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It may seem strange for exhortation or direction to be operating when we
use a function. Who is exhorting whom here?</p>
<p>In a computer program a function is ultimately an event and a process,
even in most languages that are organized on functional or
object-oriented principles. The docstring serves as a description of the
effect of that process. If we read a docstring as a second-person
command, we can take it to be directed not at the function itself
(directing it to act in a certain way) but at the processor that carries
out the function.</p>
<p>We should imagine directives being passed imperatively ("You do this…")
from the program to the CPU. I think that is the most plausible
psychology of the docstring grammar prescribed by the Erlang and Python
camps.</p>
<p>But as I have found by looking around, this is far from universal
practice in commit messages and docstrings generally.</p>
