		<div><p>The annual skateboard run down Broadway from 116th St. was canceled by
court order. Last night, the police stationed big electric signs up and
down Broadway saying "BWAYBOMB SKATEBD EVENT" ... "CANCELED BY COURT
ORDER" ... "SUBJECT TO ARREST". This morning they set up barricades here
and there and a big black loudspeaker on 116th St. with the same
message. There were at least 50 uniformed police, most standing around
looking dubious, and even some of their white collar overlords, more
poker-faced. And there were many dozens of people with skateboards
milling around — some angry and saying defiant things to each other. A
very large crowd formed on the east side of Broadway, at the Columbia
gates. A lot of people were recording events with phones, helmet cams,
and professional equipment. Orange police netting was being set up here
and there, but it was easy to walk around them — they were not hermetic.</p>
<p>I was on the street to get lunch — I have two big projects and only
enough time to do one of them, and a store-bought lunch is part of my
solution to the pressure today (the other is Kyrgyz music.)</p>
<p>Right around noon a big cheer went up, the skateboarders headed down
116th St. to Riverside Drive, and simply got on their skateboards and
sailed downtown. The police — including the poker-faced ones — made no
effort to stop them, but actually waved them officially along.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, all is quiet.</p>
<p>The city has not been the same since September 11th. But with enough of
the right sort of irreverence, it may yet return to normal — to its own
healthy chaos. Kyrgyz music helps, too.</p></div>
