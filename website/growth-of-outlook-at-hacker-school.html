		<div><p>My batch of Hacker School, "Winter 2013", is three-fourths of the way
over, with nine out of the twelve weeks past. Where do things stand with
me?</p>
<p>I've gained a great deal of concrete knowledge about programming. But
programming is a field of infinite domain. It is constantly growing, and
so concrete knowledge, while it is a central goal in my coming here,
doesn't represent a change of state within my mind. Growth of outlook is
rather the key question. And what has evolved the most in my outlook is
my relationship to this field, especially my shifting notion of how I
fit into it, unbounded though its domain may be. As a result of entering
Hacker School I have become more fully "socialized" as a programmer; as
of about the sixth week of the batch I have started to feel as though I
really am one.</p>
<p>My knowledge of tools and practices has matured since I got here, as has
my ability to discuss programming lucidly and use terms that other
programmers recognize as sound ones. I'm much more tolerant of jargon
and conscious of the names of things — software, sites, coders,
approaches — that exist and are known to other people. All these things
are fixtures of the coding world and tokens of identity. My ability to
find efficiencies that can be imposed on an existing piece of code has
improved. I don't feel able to contribute to open-source projects yet
--- though I have the sensation that that will come fairly soon, another
important step forward.</p>
<p>So much for changes to the scope of my outlook. What about the scope of
time in the learning process? I am not at a plateau yet. Plateaux are
important in the process of learning --- I would go so far as to hazard
that when we talk about "graduating", in relation to a course of study,
we are really saying "attaining a new 'grade' or plateau." I am not
ready to graduate yet in that sense. As it happens, one of the mottoes
of Hacker School is "never graduate". I take the point that this has to
do with the community's vision of itself as an unconventional place of
learning. But I think the same outlook is common among people who remain
in academia for long periods or for their working lives --- at least,
among people who pursue some branch of learning in which one has to face
the need for a division between study for its own sake and the
application of that study.</p>
<p>In a different sense, I feel that Hacker School will never end for me. I
don't know if I'll be admitted to a second batch or not --- I hope so,
but the decision is out of my hands and doesn't bear thinking about too
much. But I find I have been ushered into a frame of mind in which I see
my identity as a programmer to be legitimate and my pursuit of
programming skills and knowledge as basic to my well-being. The two
prime gifts that Hacker School confers are to have other programmers
nudge me constantly about my work, and to be in the presence of people
who are as hungry as I am to learn to program well. No matter what the
field, I am lucky to be around people like this at any time, and having
these particular surroundings is not fungible --- taking part in person
is essential and I can't imagine that a substitute could easily be
brought into being. But I foresee that even after I leave the Hacker
School environment, my frame of mind will continue to evolve in a way
that has been set in motion by what has happened to me here.</p></div>
