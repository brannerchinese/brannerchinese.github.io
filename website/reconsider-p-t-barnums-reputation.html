> Rather than suggest that Barnum was out to make his fortune by duping

> women's rights, freedom for slaves and against the machine-dominated

<blockquote>
<p>…</p>
<p>There is not a whit of evidence, suggested Mr. Saxon, that Barnum ever
said anything as callous as, "There's a sucker born every minute."</p>
<p>"There's no contemporary account of it," said Mr. Saxon, "or even any
suggestion that the word 'sucker' was used in the derogatory sense in
his day. Barnum was just not the type to disparage his patrons.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>"I'll admit, he loved a good show; a hoax. But the whole idea was that
the audience would get a laugh out of being taken in and consider it
part of the entertainment, rather than feel cheated. Barnum was not
even above being duped himself and turning it to his advantage."</p>
<p>As an example, Mr. Saxon tells of the cherry-colored cat. "In probably
the most reliable version," said Mr. Saxon, "a woman writes to Barnum
asking him to give her \$25 for her cherry-colored cat. Crackpots were
always writing to Barnum with curiosities like a three-legged chicken
or a genuine mermaid.</p>
<p>"So he said, 'Sure, bring it over.' So the woman arrives with a cat in
a bag and dumps it on the table. But it's a black cat. 'I've been
duped,' cries Barnum. 'No sir,' says the lady, 'some cherries are
black.'</p>
<p><p>
"Barnum liked the idea so much he put the cat on display," Mr. Saxon
said. "And sure enough, the public loved it, too, so much so that they
would not even give away the secret to their friends."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Saxon is the author of two books on P. T. Barnum.</p>

[<em>Edit</em>:] The <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em>, consulted 20111020,
identifies uses of <em>sucker</em> in the sense 'greenhorn, simpleton' dating
to 1838 and 1857, both North American.</p>
