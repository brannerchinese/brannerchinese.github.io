		<div><p>In the choruses that open many of the Bach cantatas, the basic
orchestral and choral setting is Baroque and flowery, but sometimes the
whole movement has been built around a <em>cantus firmus</em> or 'fixed song',
a simple melody that would have been old in Bach's time — occasionally
reaching back to the epoch of plainsong. Many such <em>cantus firmi</em> appear
in cantata's concluding chorales, but I find their setting within
opening choruses more striking.</p>
<p>Hearing the ancient melody emerge from within the larger setting, if I
am paying attention to the words and music, has the power to overwhelm
me because it forces me to recalibrate my mind away from the tempo and
organization of the rest of the setting. An ancient text of a few lines,
sung in an ancient melody in long notes, seems to seize control of the
rest of the choir and orchestra. It is like suddenly hearing a stern
voice from the past in the midst of more frivolous chatter around you.</p>
<p>Striking examples include works at the edge of popular classical music,
such as BWV 140 'Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme', as well as the German
Magnificat (BWV 10 'Meine Seel erhebt den Herren'), BWV 78 'Jesu, der du
meine Seele', BWV 26 'Ach wie flüchtig, ach wie nichtig', and the somber
BWV 4 'Christ lag in Todes Banden'.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Articles/CM-Schweitzer.htm">Albert Schweitzer left a fine essay</a> (posted in a century-old
translation on Aryeh Oron's magnificent Bach site, bach-cantatas.com)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After Bach, the bonds between the chorale and the sacred song are
completely broken. The melodies that Emmanuel Bach, Johann Joachim
Quantz, Johann Adam Hiller and Beethoven wrote, in artistic rivalry,
to Gellert's poems only show what a distance separated them all from
the chorale.</p>
<p>In the epoch of Rationalism, it is true, the melodies were not diluted
to the same extent as the text; but there was still a hard struggle
until the old melodies were again rehabilitated everywhere, and were
no longer jostled in the chorale books by the characterless tunes of
the later epoch. Now that this has been achieved, the dispute today is
as to whether we shall retain the old chorales with the uniform
note-values in which we have received them from the eighteenth
century, or whether we should restore to them their original rhythmic
variety. A definite decision, indeed, is hardly possible. Each "pro"
that can be adduced from historical, artistic, or practical
considerations is at once opposed by a "contra" of equal force in its
way. Bach is concerned in this controversy to the extent that those
who advocate the uniform polished form of chorales can plead that,
although the opposite tradition had a powerful following all round
him, he felt no artistic compulsion to revert to the old rhythmic form
of the chorale, and so there is no cogent objection, from the purely
musical point of view, against the chorale as we have received it from
his hands. Against the enthusiasts for the rhythmic melodies the old
master can plead as St. Paul once did against the Corinthians who knew
all things much better, that he too thinks he is possessed by the
spirit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Neither <em>flüchtig</em> nor <em>nichtig</em>, in this case.</p></div>
