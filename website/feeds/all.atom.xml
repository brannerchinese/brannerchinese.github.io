Bernard Baruch (1870–1965):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"During my eighty-seven years I have witnessed a whole succession of
technological revolutions. But none of them has done away with the
need for character in the individual or the ability to think." Here is
what I said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with Baruch. Certainly no tool is more reliable than the hand
that uses it. We witness spectacular miscalculations in the management
of sophisticated technology — nuclear plants breached by earthquakes,
wars launched for shifting reasons and with immense collateral death
tolls, the sudden collapse of economic structures. We ourselves cause
these events to become disasters, by putting faith in tools and
mechanisms without cultivating sufficient skill and judgment to manage
them. Naturally so; tools tend to fail at “edge cases”, and edge cases
are often hard to plan for. The situation is just as Baruch says, but I
suggest that “character and the ability to think” are themselves
actually a kind of technology, to be developed and propagated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I share Baruch’s pessimism about viewing every new technology in
messianic terms; in fact, I think the problems of human existence remain
surprisingly alike over time. Granted, our tools for use against those
problems have improved enormously, but we remain plagued by basic
issues: slavery, hunger, hatred, theft, betrayal of trust, and so on.
Consider the suffering caused by preventable diseases. According to the
WHO, for instance, easily curable pneumonia and diarrhea still kill well
over two million children every year.* No one, however greedy or
unfeeling, can think the death of two million children a year from
diarrhea is insignificant, and yet somehow humankind does not seem able
to prevent it decisively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where Baruch’s incisive apothegm does not cut deeply enough is in
showing the reach of “character and thinking.” To set against the
diarrhea problem we already have effective tools and people with the
necessary character and ability to think, but we fail to concentrate our
collective will so that the problem actually gets and stays solved.
Apparently humankind needs a mechanism for forcing decisive action that
we all agree is desirable. The real source of our failure to solve
problems like death from diarrhea is narrow self-interest, something
deeply seated in human nature. Some of the effects of self-interest are
valuable, so learning to control it intelligently is the most crucial
domain of character and thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Baruch, I want to make change in the world using my gifts. As a
professor, I am in a position of power from which to promote a moderate
altruism in my students, at least among themselves, through my own
example. I try to be generous toward them with my time; I grade in such
a way as to encourage responsible collaboration; I try to speak my mind
peaceably in case of differences of opinion; I try not to hide the
mistakes I make in our subject; and so on. I tell students that,
whatever their politics, they belong to the world’s elite by virtue of
the education they have received. Above all, I require them to help each
other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not know whether doing those things myself really motivates my
students to practice the same behavior. But I act on the premise that
“character and thinking,” though costly to cultivate and at times a
nuisance to use in those edge cases where technology fails us, are
humankind’s most powerful tools. As tools, then, they are something not
different from “technology” and can be propagated. Displaying their
effectiveness through my own example is, I hope, part of a technology
revolution whose potential Bernard Baruch would not dismiss.&lt;/p&gt;

at the Institute for Advanced Study and at Princeton University on 19–20
November of this year. A few of the sinologists from the School of
Historical Studies at the IAS dined with him after his first talk. I had
not realized that Loewe had once been at Bletchley Park and that his
initiation into the languages of East Asia came in a rudimentary course
in Japanese, hurriedly thrown together for Bletchley workers in the
weeks after Pearl Harbor. It began in February, 1942.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living as I now do in the oddly-configured space between sinology and
computer science, the conversation was a particular delight for me.
Bletchley Park is one of the landmarks in the evolution of computer
science before the invention of the transistor. And while I am not prone
to the worship of people or things, it was a pleasure to have the
company of this hale 91-year old scholar for an evening and hear him
reminisce in his own voice about cryptography seventy years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loewe told us a number of stories of Bletchley, and I won't repeat them
here as I see they are essentially all documented in his seven-page
paper "Japanese Naval Codes" in the Hinsley and Stripp &lt;em&gt;Codebreakers&lt;/em&gt;
book.[1] I had not read this book before, and would like to recommend it
here. It is thickly stocked with personal memoirs of the Bletchley Park
work by thirty different participants, and should satisfy any reader's
hunger for historical and technical detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Bletchley is most famous for the reconstruction-at-a-distance of
the settings of the Enigma machine, associated in memory with the
stellar name of Alan Turing, I was more impressed by the descriptions of
the collaborative nature of all the cryptographic work and of the study
of Tunny and Sturgeon — code names for the two other German
cryptographic machines. And still more striking was to realize how much
of the work at Bletchley was of no Computer-Science interest at all. It
was exceedingly dreary clerical labor, performed manually at all hours
of the day, because the vast majority of Axis cryptographic tools
consisted of simple ciphers and codes, applied by hand to plaintext and
then decoded by hand. If there is any Computer-Science lesson in all
this drudgery, it is only that automation initially enabled ciphers to
resist decryption more robustly and to introduce greater
variability-with-reproducibility to the encryption process; that
robustness and reproducibility are what drove Turing and the others to
their mathematical advances. As for Japanese, Loewe and the other
Bletchley writers make clear how minor a subject it was in English
wartime cryptography. All the work they did on it was clerical in nature
and very low-level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was charmed by Loewe's accent. I transcribed a few distinctive
expressions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[mai-θə-ˈlɒ-dʒɪ-kl̩]: mythological&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[ˈju-njukʰ]: eunuch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[ˈɛm-pʰɹʌ]: emperor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[ˈlai-bɹiː]: library&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;full trust of his loyalty: I would use "in" rather than "of" here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a forward protagonist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first two of these were completely new to me and surprising. He also
pronounced the second half of Milton Keynes, the major town near
Bletchley Park (now the borough containing it), as [kʰeinz]. He gave the
name of the course of study in (Western) Classics that he had been
enrolled in at Cambridge before Bletchley as "Classical Mods" — short
for Classical Moderations, a name that remains in use today. The
expression "moderations" apparently has to do with the fact that this
curriculum features examination by disputation, conducted by faculty
"moderators". Good training for sinology and cryptography, even if of
the dreary clerical variety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loewe's surname is pronounced ['lou-wiː].&lt;/p&gt;

different work from David Kahn's &lt;em&gt;Codebreakers&lt;/em&gt;, a more general history

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The myth of the framework can be stated in one sentence, as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rational and fruitful discussion is impossible unless the
participants share a common framework of basic assumptions or, at
least, unless they have agreed on such a framework for the purpose of
discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the formulation I gave of the myth, it is a &lt;em&gt;fruitful&lt;/em&gt; discussion
which is declared impossible. Against this I shall defend the directly
opposite thesis: that a discussion between people who share many views
is unlikely to be fruitful, even though it may be pleasant; while a
discussion between vastly different frameworks can be extremely
fruitful, even though it may sometimes be extremely difficult, and
&lt;em&gt;perhaps&lt;/em&gt; not quite so pleasant (though we may learn to enjoy it).&lt;/p&gt;

I don't
think I've written here about my experience on the interviews yet, and
I'll do so now. There was so much to say about the second of them that I
failed to compose either a diary entry or any letters to friends
containing much of value. So what follows is reconstructed from later
notes and my memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was admitted, the practice was to conduct two interviews. The
first was a general conversation begetting I suppose a sense of my
personal (not professional) goals in applying to Hacker School and how
my personality would mesh with the rest of the ecosystem of the place.
The second one, which had to be done with a different person, involved
pairing on some piece of code that I had already written — adding a
small feature or refactoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At core, both of these are evaluations of personality. So I can't offer
any advice beyond: be your own true self, and in the pairing interview
share your actual thinking about the details of your code. Hacker School
is a very effective environment for someone who reflects critically
about how his code works and reacts without prickliness to other
people's suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the pairing interview I submitted a Python progress-bar class that I
remembered worked when I stopped work on it half a year before. Thirty
minutes before the interview I tried it out, found it was broken, and
went into high hysterics trying to figure out what was wrong. That
proved to be much better preparation for the interview than all the
placid reading of the code that I had done earlier. I fixed the last of
the bugs a minute or so before the interview started, and was in a good
state of mind to talk confidently about details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interviewer asked me to walk her through the code, and as I did I
pointed out places where there I thought I could improve functionality.
I started out on a fairly high level, but the interviewer wanted to know
about details of implementation. My little class relied on the
&lt;code&gt;multiprocessing&lt;/code&gt; module to run the progress bar independently of the
task whose progress was being tracked and continually received
information from the task as &lt;code&gt;ctypes&lt;/code&gt; values, and we talked a bit about
that. At the very end she asked me how the use of &lt;code&gt;multiprocessing&lt;/code&gt;
affected running time, something I had not yet learned how to measure
and consider. (I started doing so immediately after the interview; the
answer is that running time is affected to a disastrous degree, a cost
of something like a thirteen-fold slowdown. The project now lives in a
directory named &lt;code&gt;abandoned_but_do_not_discard&lt;/code&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also commented on my style of naming imported modules, for instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;random&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;R&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;multiprocessing&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;ctypes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Any module with a long name or that I refer to often I name with one or
at most two capital letters. That saves typing and makes it easy to see
quickly and unambiguously when a module is in use. The interviewer
remarked that she hadn't seen that done before and wondered where I
learned it. I no longer recall where I learned it or whether it was my
own shortcut. When I joined the batch I was told it wasn't part of best
practice and I stopped using it, but I've started again recently; I
think it's effective and clear to anyone reading the code with
sufficient care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My feeling was that the interview went well. But when I heard back from
Hacker School at the end of the day I observed that I felt surprised
that I had been admitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't recommend Hacker School enough for someone in a situation like
mine. At the institution's request for a testimonial recently I
described that situation and Hacker School's effect as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came to programming after a decades-long career in a totally
unrelated and non-quantitative field. After exposure to a couple of
programming languages, and after taking some math and theory courses,
I was still a very green peach. Hacker School ripened me into the ways
of the guild of coders: I learned how to read other people's code, to
pair-program, to ask for help in a way that was useful to myself and
others; I got used to jargon, along with how and when to use it; I
learned various best practices and the names of many, many tools.
Above all else, I learned to think of myself as a coder, really and
truly, and I find myself now part of a growing family of pleasant,
helpful brother- and sister-coders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are things I would like to say about what I see as the long-term
effects of the presence of this group of "pleasant, helpful brother- and
sister-coders" in the field. But I will save that for another day.&lt;/p&gt;

been thinking more about it today. My inclination has always been to
make a commit message a description of my own actions in relation to my
code or the state of the project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;updated database&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;fixed all remaining bugs; README still skimpy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;refactored main() to find &amp;amp; use most current dump&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as I described in the earlier post, I was surprised to find that
there is widespread and competing advocacy of the principle that we
should write in either present tense or imperative mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Present tense and imperative mood are not the same thing, and if you
read actual examples from around the Web, you quickly find that
prescriptions and implementation of commit-grammar vary quite a bit.
GitHub seems to advocate using present or simple past tense:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you make a commit in a non-default branch with the "Fixes #33"
syntax, the issue is referenced with a tooltip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use any of the following keywords to close an issue via commit
message:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;close&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;closes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;closed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fix&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fixes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fixed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;resolve&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;resolves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;resolved&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages"&gt;https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages&lt;/a&gt;;
cf. [http://gitref.org/basic/#commit][], which does not discuss
issues of grammar at all; both accessed 20131018)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drupal advocates past tense:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, commit messages start with the (past tense) verb&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Added" (new feature)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Fixed" (bug fix)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Changed" (task)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Updated" (task, due to changes in third-party code)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may not be trivial to phrase a summary starting with one of those
verbs. But if used consistently, you will get used to it. When not
using these verbs, make sure you prefix the commit message with the
issue category. (&lt;a href="https://drupal.org/node/52287"&gt;https://drupal.org/node/52287&lt;/a&gt;, accessed 20131018)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erlang advocates using a command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write the summary line and description of what you have done in the
imperative mode, that is as if you were commanding someone. Write
“fix”, “add”, “change” instead of “fixed”, “added”, “changed”.
(&lt;a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/wiki/Writing-good-commit-messages"&gt;https://github.com/erlang/otp/wiki/Writing-good-commit-messages&lt;/a&gt;,
accessed 20131018)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python officially prescribes using commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The docstring is a phrase ending in a period. It prescribes the
function or method's effect as a command ("Do this", "Return that"),
not as a description; e.g. don't write "Returns the pathname ...".
(&lt;a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257"&gt;http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257&lt;/a&gt;, by David Goodger and Guido
van Rossum, accessed 20131018)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't see prescriptions for &lt;a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html#commit-your-changes"&gt;Ruby&lt;/a&gt;, Java, or C++. The &lt;a href="http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Style-of-Change-Logs.html#Style-of-Change-Logs"&gt;discussion of
GNU change-log style&lt;/a&gt; doesn't seem to have any English syntax in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Erlang and Python model is so strange, and so insistent about
avoiding the more natural practice of simple description, that it
requires adding some energy in order to understand what is going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes the use of a command in a commit-message or docstring
unsettling is trying to see how it relates to the use of the commit or
function it goes with. (A commit can be understood as a kind of function
acting on one's repository, so from now on I'll refer only to functions
and docstrings.) A command implies direction, instruction, exhortation,
or persuasion. As a matter of grammar, imperative mood takes a number of
forms — the second person ("you") form is most familiar in English,
where the speaker tells the hearer or reader what to do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go away!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give that grain of rice back back to the farmer you got it from at
once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't even think about parking here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may seem strange for exhortation or direction to be operating when we
use a function. Who is exhorting whom here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a computer program a function is ultimately an event and a process,
even in most languages that are organized on functional or
object-oriented principles. The docstring serves as a description of the
effect of that process. If we read a docstring as a second-person
command, we can take it to be directed not at the function itself
(directing it to act in a certain way) but at the processor that carries
out the function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should imagine directives being passed imperatively ("You do this…")
from the program to the CPU. I think that is the most plausible
psychology of the docstring grammar prescribed by the Erlang and Python
camps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as I have found by looking around, this is far from universal
practice in commit messages and docstrings generally.&lt;/p&gt;

all file timestamps, including even creation date. That is very cavalier
indeed, since file timestamps are an important resource available to us
to untangle the occasional merge-gone-wrong, not to mention keeping
track of files that may have had a meaningful history outside of the
repository. It will not do to overwrite this information silently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Losing file timestamps is a serious problem for me, and it means that
from today on, unless I find a work-around, I will use Git much more
reservedly than I might otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

Markdown standard, has a couple of unsatisfactory features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One is that there is no testing tool (such as the &lt;a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus"&gt;Markdown Dingus&lt;/a&gt;
readily available, so the first time you write markdown you have to
commit the file before you can see the result. That's bad design, since
one the file is committed you can edit it on line and see what it looks
like without committing again. So preview functionality exists; it just
isn't available on the initial creation of a markdown file. And so the
first time, you're stuck with whatever you produce. As a GitHub Flavored
WorkAround I sometimes insert my new text into an existing markdown file
and edit it until it looks the way I want it too, then copy it to the
new file, canceling the changes to the existing file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another issue is that although you can turn soft-wrap on or off while
editing; at present there doesn't seem to be a way to assign soft-wrap
to one's default settings. I've written to GitHub tech support to
suggest this, but the people who responded didn't seem to know what I
was talking about and didn't follow up. I let it drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long time GFM didn't support HTML tables directly. You had to use
a special GFM syntax for markdown tables, which has undocumented
restrictions as to what you can do with it. You apparently cannot have
merged cells or more than one hyphen-delimited line of header cells. Why
is that important? Because it is very useful to be able to show a single
merged header-cell representing two subordinate columns, each of which
has its own subheader cell. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;table&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;border=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;2&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;cellpadding=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;5&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;cellspacing=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;th&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;rowspan=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;2&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;(empty)&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;th&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;rowspan=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;2&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;merged rows&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;th&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;colspan=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;2&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;merged columns&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;th&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;unmerged&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;~~~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In HTML it produces:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th rowspan="2"&gt;(empty)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th rowspan="2"&gt;merged rows&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th colspan="2"&gt;merged columns&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;unmerged&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;unmerged&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th rowspan="2"&gt;merged rows&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td&gt;row 1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;content 1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;content 2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;row 2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;content 1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;content 2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as I say, the good news is that HTML tables are now supported in
GFM.&lt;/p&gt;

in his decades at the Institute, never attended lectures except once a
year, and that was always one given by one of his friends. He spent a
lot of time in private conversation with Kurt Gödel, who never gave any
public talks at all. Einstein himself gave one lecture a year, always
massively attended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick J. Geary, one of the permanent professors in the School of
Historical Studies, tells me that in the early decades, most of the
members were from German academia or other places in Europe where codes
of academic prestige were rigid. At meals there was the equivalent of
the "high table" of the ancient English universities, and sitting there
was a privilege closely guarded by those who already had seats. At some
point the critical mass of American-born scholars, and the shift away
from elitist identification in American society, led to the
disappearance of this high table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way things are now, members and professors all sit together — there
are normally four long tables at which people tend to sit according to
which of the four Schools they are are in, but there are no rules about
where you must sit or social precedence, and there are also smaller
tables for solitary or smaller conversations. Socializing and meeting
people in remote fields is one of the chief attractions for me at the
Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As tempting as the many lectures at the Institute and Princeton are, I
feel sorely conflicted about giving my time to them, since I have much
to do and the number of my days here is small. There are three meetings
every two weeks that one is expected to attend, but that's really it. On
my second day at the Institute, Nicola di Cosmo, another of the
permanent Historical School professors, urged me, "Guard your time" —
and I take that as license to be selfish about how I spend my "light and
shade" (光陰: time, considered as a precious commodity).&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Karl Popper against foundations of knowledge (1965)</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/karl-popper-against-foundations-of-knowledge-1965.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-10-01T09:15:00-04:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2013-10-01:karl-popper-against-foundations-of-knowledge-1965.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Karl Popper (1902–94):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The critical rationalist never tries to &lt;em&gt;establish&lt;/em&gt; a theory about the
world; he does not believe in 'foundations'. Yet he may believe — as I
do — that if we produce many competing ideas, and criticize them
severely, we &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt;, if we are lucky, get nearer to the truth. This
method is the method of &lt;em&gt;conjectures and refutations&lt;/em&gt;: it is the
method of taking many risks, by producing many (competing) hypotheses;
of making many mistakes; and of trying to correct or eliminate some of
these mistakes by a critical discussion of the competing hypotheses. I
believe that this is &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; method of the natural sciences, including
cosmology, and I think that it can be applied also to philosophical
problems. ... Nothing in our intellectual life is exempt from this
process of criticism and error elimination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freedom of the intellect means the freedom to report what one has
seen, heard, and felt, and not to be obliged to fabricate imaginary
facts and feelings. … The argument that to tell the truth would be
'inopportune' or would 'play into the hands of' somebody or other is
felt to be unanswerable, and few people are bothered by the prospect
of the lies which they condone getting out of the newspapers and into
the history books. … The organized lying practiced by totalitarian
states is not, as is sometimes claimed, a temporary expedient of the
same nature as military deception. It is something integral to
totalitarianism. … It is pointed out that all historical records are
biased and inaccurate, or on the other hand, that modern physics has
proven that what seems to us the real world is an illusion, so that to
believe in the evidence of one's senses is simply vulgar philistinism.
… Already there are countless people who would think it scandalous to
falsify a scientific textbook, but would see nothing wrong in
falsifying an historical fact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swift was a kind of anarchist, and Part IV of &lt;em&gt;Gulliver's Travels&lt;/em&gt; is
a picture of an anarchistic Society, not governed by law in the
ordinary sense, but by the dictates of 'Reason', which are voluntarily
accepted by everyone. ... This illustrates very well the totalitarian
tendency which is explicit in the anarchist or pacifist vision of
Society. In a Society in which there is no law, and in theory no
compulsion, the only arbiter of behaviour is public opinion. But
public opinion, because of the tremendous urge to conformity in
gregarious animals, is less tolerant than any system of law. When
human beings are governed by 'thou shalt not', the individual can
practise a certain amount of eccentricity: when they are supposedly
governed by 'love' or 'reason', he is under continuous pressure to
make him behave and think in exactly the same way as everyone else.
... It is often argued, at least by people who admit the importance of
subject-matter, that a book cannot be 'good' if it expresses a
palpably false view of life. We are told that in our own age, for
instance, any book that has genuine literary merit will also be more
or less 'progressive' in tendency. This ignores the fact that
throughout history a similar struggle between progress and reaction
has been raging, and that the best books of any one age have always
been written from several different viewpoints, some of them palpably
more false than others.&lt;/p&gt;

tour of the place on Friday. It resembles nothing so much as a cloister
designed to facilitate scholarship. The campus is isolated from
Princeton University and all shopping — even food and coffee, while
within reach, are rather limited. (I've brought my own coffee delivery
system.) The whole institute is compact but has plenty of room for walks
to stimulate thinking and conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The administrative staff bends over backwards to ensure that scholars
have the material support we need. I am impressed at the range of
equipment that is available and the speed at which what isn't gets
delivered. I requested a second computer monitor and it came within the
day; I asked for help setting up a proper standing workstation and by
day's end had a visit from someone who knew all the options — although
he said it was the first such request he'd ever heard of — and arranged
for adjustment of the furniture and delivery. This goes well beyond
anything I've ever experienced in an academic setting before. Money is
available to buy equipment and pay the staff to administer it, but more
than that, the Institute is willing to spend it the money and deploy the
staff for my comfort, and to do so on almost no notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the library, too, it's clear that someone has gone to trouble to make
sure that there are scanners, capable of batch work or oversize imaging,
and a range of other mechanical tools to aid research. But I was
surprised to see that the system for checking out books is still manual.
The borrower fills out two cards for each book. One is filed under his
own name and the other by call number. Since the catalog is already set
up as a modern database, someone could write a program to track books
and users in a couple of hours, as if one did not already exist. Why has
the Institute not moved to do so? A puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it is because the need is not pressing — there seem to be no
more than a couple of hundred users at any time — and because retaining
the cards, with the signatures of previous borrowers on them for anyone
to see, allows a pleasant old tradition to survive. It's pleasant for
me, anyway. I realize that most library users today may never have
encountered this, but I used to take great pleasure in seeing the names
of people who had borrowed a book before me, especially when it was
decades earlier or the borrower was someone well known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see the use of cards as another sign of care for the study
environment.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Richard Feynman on scientific integrity (1974)</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/richard-feynman-on-scientific-integrity.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-09-19T20:51:00-04:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2013-09-19:richard-feynman-on-scientific-integrity.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Richard Feynman (1918–1988):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… There is &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; feature I notice that is generally missing in Cargo
Cult Science. That is the idea that we all hope you have learned in
studying science in school — we never explicitly say what this &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;,
but just hope that you catch on by all the examples of scientific
investigation. It is interesting, therefore, to bring it out now and
speak of it explicitly. It's a kind of scientific integrity, a
principle of scientific thought that corresponds to a kind of utter
honesty‚ a kind of leaning over backwards. For example, if you're
doing an experiment, you should report everything that you think might
make it invalid — not only what you think is right about it: other
causes that could possibly explain your results; and things you
thought of that you've eliminated by some other experiment, and how
they worked — to make sure the other fellow can tell they have been
eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details that could throw doubt on your interpretation must be given,
if you know them. You must do the best you can if you know anything at
all wrong, or possibly wrong — to explain it. If you make a theory,
for example, and advertise it, or put it out, then you must also put
down all the facts that disagree with it. …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, the idea is to try to give &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the information to help
others to judge the value of your contribution; not just the
information that leads to judgment in one particular direction or
another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to explain this idea is to contrast it, for example,
with advertising. …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've learned from experience that the truth will out. Other
experimenters will repeat your experiment and find out whether you
were wrong or right. Nature's phenomena will agree or they'll disagree
with your theory. And, although you may gain some temporary fame and
excitement, you will not gain a good reputation as a scientist if you
haven't tried to be very careful in this kind of work. And it's this
type of integrity, this kind of care not to fool yourself, that is
missing to a large extent in much of the research in Cargo Cult
Science. … (pp. 209–10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first principle is that you must not fool yourself — and you are
the easiest person to fool. So you have to be very careful about that.
After you've not fooled yourself, it's easy not to fool other
scientists. You just have to be honest in a conventional way after
that. …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm talking about a specific, extra type of integrity that is not
lying, but bending over backwards to show how you're maybe wrong, that
you ought to do when acting as a scientist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… One example of the principle is this: If you've made up your mind to
test a theory, or you want to explain some idea, you should always
decide to publish it whichever way it comes out. If we only publish
results of a certain kind, we can make the argument look good. We must
publish &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; kinds of results. … (pp. 212–13)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no more time, so I have just one wish for you — the good luck
to be somewhere where you are free to maintain the kind of integrity I
have described, and where you do not feel forced by a need to maintain
your position in the organization, or financial support, or so on, to
lose your integrity. May you have that freedom. (p. 216)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People — I mean the average person, the great majority of people, the
enormous majority of people — are woefully, pitifully, absolutely
ignorant of the science of the world that they live in, and they can
stay that way. I don't mean to say the heck with them, what I mean is
that they are able to stay that way without it worrying them at all —
only mildly — so from time to time when they see [the principle of
conservation of subatomic charge and parity] mentioned in the
newspaper they ask what it is. And an interesting question of the
relation of science to modern society is just that — why is it
possible for people to stay so woefully ignorant and yet reasonably
happy in modern society when so much knowledge is unavailable to them?
(p. 102)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we look away from the science and look at the world around us, we
find out something rather pitiful: that the environment that we live
in is so actively, intensely unscientific. (p. 106)&lt;/p&gt;

tense in Git commit messages: one is supposed to write in the present
tense, showing what the commit does, rather than what one did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I edit a file on line, BitBucket populates the commit message with
(say) "README.md edited online with Bitbucket", etc. Github, by
comparison, populates it with "Update README.md".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some useful comments about good Git commit-message style on
&lt;a href="http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html"&gt;Tim Pope's blog&lt;/a&gt;. Here are &lt;a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/pull/17#issuecomment-5659933"&gt;some remarks by Linus Torvalds&lt;/a&gt; about
commit-message style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people say one should be writing in the imperative. In Chinese, if
one uses a concise register suited to list-making, verbal aspect is
likely to be omitted, so that it may be impossible to tell the
difference between past, present, and imperative forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real question is: who or what is the subject of the verb in a commit
message? The programmer? Or the code itself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In cases where there is a difference between the English first and third
person singular, the first person sounds like the programmer speaking
(or if you're inclined that way, the code itself)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;refactor main()&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;In this commit *I* refactor main()&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;while the third person sounds like the commit's action is being
described&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;refactors main()&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;This commit refactors main()&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I can't say I see the suitability of imperative mood, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At times I find it useful not even to use a verb at all, such as when I
commit after a merge — I just enter "after merge". Is more than that
effective?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;unmatched&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;group&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'm aware of two work-arounds for this curious situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, rewrite the optional sub-expression as an optional look-ahead
marked sub-expression: &lt;code&gt;((?:ghi)?)&lt;/code&gt;. There are two pairs of parentheses:
one for the look-ahead syntax &lt;code&gt;(?:...)&lt;/code&gt; and one for the optional
matching group &lt;code&gt;(...?)&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;re&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;(abc)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;t((?:ghi)?)&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;r&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;2&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;abc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;tghi&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;ghi&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;re&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;(abc)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;t((?:ghi)?)&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;r&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;2&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;abc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;t&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Second, discard the zero-or-one operator and put a set-union operator
(metacharacter "pipe", &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;) inside the parentheses so that the
sub-expression now means "either nothing or else the target in question"
(below, &lt;code&gt;(|ghi)&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;re&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;(abc)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;t(|ghi)&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;r&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;2&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;abc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;tghi&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;ghi&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;re&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;(abc)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;t(|ghi)&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;r&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;2&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;abc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;t&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The first work-around is marginally faster than the second:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;python&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;timeit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000000&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;from re import sub&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;sub(&amp;#39;(abc)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;t((?:ghi)?)&amp;#39;, r&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;2&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;abc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;tghi&amp;#39;)&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000000&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;loops&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;best&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;6.48&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;usec&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;per&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;loop&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;python&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;timeit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000000&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;from re import sub&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;sub(&amp;#39;(abc)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;t(|ghi)&amp;#39;, r&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;2&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;abc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;tghi&amp;#39;)&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000000&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;loops&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;best&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;6.97&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;usec&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;per&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;loop&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;though it's longer to type and more complex to understand and remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I vote for the second work-around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've just noticed that the replacement version of regex now at PyPi
addresses this issue ("&lt;a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/regex"&gt;regex 2013-06-26&lt;/a&gt;"):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unmatched group in replacement: An unmatched group is treated as an
empty string in a replacement template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

with preliminary optimizations to save time by identifying partially
ordered subarrays. Part of the optimization process involves the much
slower InsertionSort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If no such subarrays are likely to be present, however, plain,
unoptimized MergeSort may be faster. And it is available to Python
through the &lt;code&gt;NumPy&lt;/code&gt; library. Below is an example in which &lt;code&gt;NumPy&lt;/code&gt;
MergeSort is a third faster than the default Python &lt;code&gt;sort&lt;/code&gt; function:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Numpy&lt;/code&gt; also supplies QuickSort and HeapSort, which are slower than
MergeSort but which sort lists without additional space complexity, as
does TimSort. See the &lt;a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.sort.html"&gt;NumPy docs&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it does not work directly on nested sequences such as a list of

&lt;span class="n"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What is the most efficient way to do that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought of three approaches:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Iteration through the first-level sequences composing the matrix,
    using a list comprehension&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flattening the matrix first&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating the matrix in flat form to begin with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My prediction was that creating the matrix in flat form to begin with
would be the fastest and that flattening the matrix first would be the
slowest. Of course, flattening a matrix is likely to increase the
running time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote five tests. For matrices with very small dimensions, my
predictions are correct. But as the dimensions become large, iterating
through the first-level sequences turned out to be significantly faster
than all other methods. &lt;strong&gt;[Wrong! There was an error in my code. I've
corrected it after the end of the original post.]&lt;/strong&gt; Below I discuss only
the two most interesting ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I populated the matrix with random floating point numbers and searched
for an additional random floating point number in it; that should give
worst-case performance since it is unlikely that any 16-digit random
numbers would appear twice in such relatively small samples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference in speed for the plain use of the &lt;code&gt;in&lt;/code&gt; operator looks
like it must involve a difference in time complexity, but I that there
is such a difference; I'd be happy to hear from anyone who can explain
this to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating the matrix in flat form to begin with&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;one-dimensional list comprehension for square matrix: O(sqrt(n))&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;in&lt;/code&gt; list: O(n)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;total complexity: O(sqrt(n)) + O(n) ∈ O(n)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the observed speed increases by about a factor of 10 for every
factor of 100 increase to &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;. That looks like O(sqrt(n)), rather than
O(n). All I can think is that &lt;code&gt;in&lt;/code&gt; must be implicitly optimized for use
with list comprehensions. But a search of documentation turns up nothing
to that effect. (I haven't yet looked at the source code.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="err"&gt;\#&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000000&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;loops&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;best&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;usec&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;per&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;loop&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now we see the 1:1 proportion between a factor of about 100 for change
in speed corresponding to a factor of 100 for change in &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;, just as the
order-of-growth equations predict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, as originally anticipated, using a linear array is, after all, much
faster than a list of lists.&lt;/p&gt;

generations of programming languages predating Python. How do I convert

&lt;p&gt;Three small calculations are needed to convert between an index and the
corresponding row_number and column_number:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;    &lt;span class="n"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;row_number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;total_columns&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;column_number&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;column_number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;total_columns&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c"&gt;# Python 3, non-integer division&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;row_number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;column_number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;total_columns&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c"&gt;# Alternately, by integer division&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;row_number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;total_columns&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for "non-integer division", Guido van Rossum proposed "float division" for this: ([http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2001-March/013444.html], 20010311, accessed 20130722)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am working with SQLite3 in Python but am not yet at the stage of using
an ORM such as SQLAlchemy. But I had the idea that I could save trouble
by writing a function to produce &lt;code&gt;INSERT&lt;/code&gt; statements generically —
without having to write them out manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is what I came up with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An example of my original inline &lt;code&gt;INSERT&lt;/code&gt; statements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The same insertion carried out by a generic function&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;kanji_fields&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;OrderedDict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;kanji_traditional&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;kanji_traditional&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;kanji_simplified&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;kanji_simplified&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;time_of_commit&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;timestamp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;insert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cursor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;kanji&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;kanji_fields&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;insert()&lt;/code&gt; function called above&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;CustomException&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ne"&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;pass&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;insert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cursor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;table_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;field_ordereddict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;raise_error_or_not&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="c"&gt;# prepare replacement fields for SQL field names&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Notes on parameters:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cursor&lt;/code&gt; is instantiated as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;con&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sqlite3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;connect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;con&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;cursor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;con&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cursor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and passed to this function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Virtues&lt;/strong&gt;. Chiefly modularity and readability. This design worked, and I was able to replace a number of long, messy in-line &lt;code&gt;INSERT&lt;/code&gt; statements with neat &lt;code&gt;insert()&lt;/code&gt; calls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drawbacks&lt;/strong&gt;. However, The time required increased by a factor of 3.2, which I judge fatal to my project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Going forward&lt;/strong&gt;. Using &lt;code&gt;OrderedDict&lt;/code&gt; to keep field-names and their contents organized improved readability:&lt;/li&gt;

that Grace Hopper (1906–92) coined the term or at least used it in jest
after an actual moth got into a vacuum-tube installation and cause a
short circuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It occurs to me that the expression may originally derive from the much
older usage of "bug" in the sense of a disturbing or irritating
annoyance. The current on-line edition of the &lt;em&gt;Oxford English
Dictionary&lt;/em&gt; defines this word:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;an object of terror, usually an imaginary one; a bugbear, hobgoblin,
bogy; a scarecrow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and suggests a connection to Welsh &lt;em&gt;bwg&lt;/em&gt; [bʊg] 'a ghost' and to English
&lt;em&gt;bogey&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;bugbear&lt;/em&gt;. There are similar (if not cognate) forms in
various other Celtic languages. The dictionary offers English citations
from the 15th and 16th centuries onward. A 17th century text has
"Timerous Fools, that are afraid of Buggs." This is the same sense as
"gremlin", an imaginary and somewhat malicious creature to which we
attribute problems in machinery. At present "computer bug" is not
connected to &lt;em&gt;bwg&lt;/em&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;OED&lt;/em&gt;, but I find the idea of a link
attractive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;OED&lt;/em&gt; also relates our &lt;em&gt;booger&lt;/em&gt; ("hard snot") to a regional US word
&lt;em&gt;booger&lt;/em&gt; defined "menacing supernatural creature; a goblin, bogy, or
ghost"; an 1891 citation is the oldest supplied: "[A ball of mucus in
the nose is] Called bugger in the South, the u sounded like [ʊ]." I
suppose the key idea is that a booger "bugs" you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming the Welsh connection to &lt;em&gt;boogeyman&lt;/em&gt; and its kin to be correct,
I imagine that computer "bug" is the same morpheme. I wonder if anyone
but me can be persuaded to begin calling computer bugs "bwgs" and
pronouncing them as "boog" ([bʊg]); debugging would become "debwgging",
and so on.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Using python str.format(*args) when the cardinality of *args is unknown</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/using-python-str-formatargs-when-the-cardinality-of-args-is-unknown.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-07-15T23:19:00-04:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2013-07-15:using-python-str-formatargs-when-the-cardinality-of-args-is-unknown.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Python 3's &lt;code&gt;str.format()&lt;/code&gt; function inserts its arguments into
replacement fields delimited by braces &lt;code&gt;{}&lt;/code&gt; in the string &lt;code&gt;str&lt;/code&gt;. The
arguments of &lt;code&gt;format()&lt;/code&gt; can include tuple- or keyword-arguments whose
length may be uncertain before runtime, and they will be unpacked when
&lt;code&gt;format()&lt;/code&gt; is actually called.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, even if the arguments are of uncertain number, it seems to me
that the bracket-delimited replacement fields in &lt;code&gt;str&lt;/code&gt; are normally not.
Only if the string is constructed by concatenation in response to the
number of arguments of &lt;code&gt;format&lt;/code&gt; is it possible for each of those
arguments to be assured a corresponding replacement field:&lt;/p&gt;

replacement fields, if that number is not known until runtime?&lt;/p&gt;

English physicist Arthur Eddington concocted pseudoscientific "proofs"

    lost your last copy). Thumbprint is used as password; the founders

    suitable for massive elaboration. This was a final project of the

    what this school program has managed to accomplish, based on the
    head's brief comments and my own tour of the website
    (http://www.stuycs.org/). Surely this is a part of our way forward

&lt;p&gt;It begins:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the fine aesthetic pleasures of Chinese is the indeterminacy of
parts of speech. We meet with words that appear intrinsically to be
nouns but are being used as verbs, or words that are intrinsically
verbs but are being used as nouns. Both kinds may also behave as
adverbs. One of the central skills we cultivate when we learn Chinese,
and especially Classical Chinese, is how to hold basic meanings
tentatively in mind while we manipulate their possible parts of speech
until they all fit together as a plausible string of meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

that it has been taking a noticeable amount of time to look through
before I empty it every few days. The steep increase in spam may
possibly be connected to the large number of new contacts I made through
Hacker School earlier this year, though I have no way to be sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have taken a new step to deal with the Spam folder: filtering messages
whose &lt;code&gt;From&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Subject&lt;/code&gt; values contain the most common spam contents,
and deleting those messages before they even make it to the Spam folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has dramatically reduced the amount of crap I have to wade through
to clear the Spam folder, but I have no doubt there is now a greater
chance of losing messages I don't want to lose. But that seems to be the
trade ahead of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment Google only seems to provide a relatively simple filtering
tool. A further option is to access the account directly via SMTP and
run scripts of my own against selected targets.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Isaac Newton, creationist</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/isaac-newton-creationist.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-07-04T00:20:00-04:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2013-07-04:isaac-newton-creationist.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It is well known that Newton was not only religious but what we today

he feared would imperil his immortal soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I think it is not clearly remembered today that he was an actual

calculator has something wrong with it — at least, its results today
(20130626) do not make sense to me. My code uses two slightly different
but congruent equations for the exact test and reports them both (Ghent
1, Soper 2). Since the on-line calculator appears not to be working
correctly today, I have tested my results against the reported results
of Kirkman (3); they are confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;

about educational psychology in application to learning to be a better
coder. Among many interesting ideas, she introduced the notion of the
"zone of proximal development," a state of partial competence in the
presence of some more competent party or in a collaborative environment.
Of course, if you think about it, much of our learning takes place in
such a zone. She had interesting things to say about how Hacker School's
educational model, which you might call "the collective drives of
individuals in loose association", encourages this particular kind of
learning, neither wholly independent nor whole subordinate to an
expert's direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea led me to reflect on an important element of my own
problem-solving experience. When I'm in a bind — usually not thinking as
clear-headedly as I could about something — if I then imagine myself in
conversation with someone I think of as smarter or more rational or more
sensible than I am, I soon perceive some good, some unexpected
suggestion made to me by that person. It seems to come to me from that
person. Well, the person was not actually there; at times the person is
even dead and disintegrated. But the suggestion I perceive them making
normally helps me get past my own block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though this suggestion will have arisen entirely within my own
mind, my mind seems to require the catalyst of envisioning it coming
from someone else. I suspect that what is really happening is that my
brain is somehow reviving or reenacting the past experience of having
had such a person force me to think in an unaccustomed way, and that
process of reenactment leads me to a new way of envisioning the
situation I am now dealing with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have taken to trying to convey to my students the value of this
experience. I tell them in so many words that after our class has ended
and they have gone off to other tasks, to "conjure me" when they face a
difficult problem in the future — try to hear my voice then, to recall
then what my responses to them have been now, as we are cutting our way
through the jungle of Classical Chinese grammar together. If my own
experience is a guide, then having with them the example of my guidance
will enable their own minds to solve problems in ways that may have
escaped their attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean that the past guidance of others sometimes enables us to learn —
really to learn, and really to think in a fresh way — even when we are
actually alone. It seems to me that the zone of proximal development
doesn't always require actual proximity to other people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mel's talk tonight was a version of this public lecture given at PyCon

populate a Python container. The language is organized so that large
lists, dictionaries, and tuples can be constructed more efficiently —
and so more quickly — with a comprehension than with a corresponding
loop over an &lt;code&gt;append&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt; operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a loop such as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;the_list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;container&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;the_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;we write a comprehension as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;the_list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;container&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside: More generally, a group of nested for statements in a nested
loop undergoes only minimal change in order when replaced with a
comprehension; we replace&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;the_list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;container&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c"&gt;# outermost for statement&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;subitem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c"&gt;# next outermost for statement&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;subsubitem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;subitem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c"&gt;# next outermost&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="c"&gt;# ...&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="n"&gt;the_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;the_list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;container&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;subitem&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;subsubitem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The improvement in speed is considerable (Python 3.3):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;python&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;timeit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s"&gt;from random import random as R&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s"&gt;list = []&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s"&gt;for item in range(10000):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s"&gt;    list.append(R())&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;loops&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;best&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.08&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;msec&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;per&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;loop&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;python&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;timeit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s"&gt;from random import random as R&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s"&gt;[item for item in range(10000)]&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;loops&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;best&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;334&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;usec&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;per&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;loop&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(Note the primitive use of "u" for μ in "usec" (μsec). But the savings
becomes smaller for deeply nested loops.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, for a set:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;the_set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;container&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;the_set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;we write&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;the_set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;container&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;and for a dictionary (mapping) we replace&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;container&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;mapping&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mapping&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;container&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For some tasks, such as converting a list of lists to a tuple of tuples,
the improvement in speed is quite striking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;python&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;timeit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;random&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;random&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;R&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;a_list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;R&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;R&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot; &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;new_tuple&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;new_tuple&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tuple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;loops&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;best&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.82&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;msec&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;per&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;loop&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;python&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;timeit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;random&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;random&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;R&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;a_list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;R&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;R&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot; &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;new_tuple&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;tuple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tuple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b_list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;loops&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;best&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;224&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;usec&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;per&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;loop&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(I included the unnecessary &lt;code&gt;'new_tuple = ()&lt;/code&gt; in the timeit expression
for the comprehension so that it would be more exactly comparable to the
loop.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A comprehension recalls the format of a mathematical set. Using one to
create a list, rather than a loop with &lt;code&gt;append&lt;/code&gt;, is one of the signs of
an experienced Python programmer. But for concatenating lists (or other
sequences) it can actually be faster to use a loop if the &lt;code&gt;extend&lt;/code&gt;
operation is involved. Here the task is to concatenate a list of lists
into a single list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;python&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;timeit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;random&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;random&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;R&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;a_list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;R&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;R&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;b_list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot; &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;b_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;extend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;100000&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;loops&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;best&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;7.04&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;usec&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;per&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;loop&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;subitem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a_list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;subitem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;

the language; compare those Python 3.3 timings with Python 2.7:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[end]&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>The name "Hacker School"</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/the-name-hacker-school.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-05-23T17:43:00-04:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2013-05-23:the-name-hacker-school.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I spent three months this year in the Winter 2013 batch of &lt;a href="http://hackerschool.com"&gt;Hacker
School&lt;/a&gt;. Below are some thoughts on what the organization is — since
the name is misleading, to say the least — excerpted from my feedback to
the organization. (In an &lt;a href="http://brannerchinese.wordpress.com/2013/02/11/two-things-i-am-thinking-about-as-hacker-school-begins/" title="Two things I am thinking about as Hacker School begins"&gt;earlier post&lt;/a&gt; I've mentioned the fact that
"hacker" has a far more noxious meaning in the press and at large that
it does among programmers, but never mind that now.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not actually a school at all, except in the sense that being in it
was a lot like graduate school (I wrote &lt;a href="http://brannerchinese.wordpress.com/2013/03/30/is-hacker-school-like-graduate-school/" title="Is Hacker School like graduate school?"&gt;a blog post about that&lt;/a&gt;). But
what it *is* is less easy to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Retreat" is used on the website's "about" page, along with "immersive
school". These are not bad, but I don't think either one exhausts the
meaning of the experience, not with eloquence anyway. It seems to me
that the problem with "retreat" is that there isn't really removal,
either physical or mental, from the rest of the world. "School" strongly
suggests a curriculum or program, which of course there isn't. Even if
students set their own programs, that isn't a school — it's an arena for
self-study, a different thing in essential features. Oh, go ahead and
use "school" if you need to for other purposes, but in plain truth the
word doesn't fit comfortably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've used "dojo" to describe the physical place where the batch meets.
That's good because it suggests the self-cultivation that is such an
explicit part of Japanese training in all the traditional arts. But it's
bad because a dojo is always associated with a sensei, one sensei who is
part of a tradition (even if it is the venerable tradition of standing
apart from tradition), and not only do we have no sensei in that strict
sense, we also have no sect or "school" or tradition in the intellectual
aspect of the word. Similarly, a friend who lived some time among
Jesuits said of my description of Hacker School that "it sounds like
life at a monastery" — let's not say anything about celibacy, but Hacker
School fails to meet the definition because there is no abbot and no
order (in the sense of a religious ideology or theological affiliation).
And as with "retreat", the word fails because we are not cloistered
here. If Hacker School has any ideology, it is that of the rain
forest-like chaos of the hacking world at large. Dojo and monastery,
both of which involve adherence to hierarchical rules, are not the right
names for a place that encourages this state of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Collaborative studio" might do to describe Hacker School. "Gymnasium"
also might do. Neither requires a sensei or abbot figure, and each
suggests a place where people can work, independently or together, at
training themselves or producing work that depends on discipline or
reflective exertion or craftsmanship. That seems to me the essential
point. I recommend those two expressions, then, to describe Hacker
School.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Collaborative studio" and "gymnasium" are what I say now, describing
Hacker School when I talk to people who understand about
self-cultivation. When forced to talk to grown-ups, I have been
describing Hacker School as a tech recruitment company that offers
unpaid training-internships.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>The benefits of Hacker School</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/the-benefits-of-hacker-school.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-05-23T17:40:00-04:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2013-05-23:the-benefits-of-hacker-school.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I spent three months this year in the Winter 2013 batch of &lt;a href="http://hackerschool.com"&gt;Hacker
School&lt;/a&gt;. Below are some thoughts on what it did for me, excerpted from
my feedback to the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hacker School gave me a critical mass of people with whom I could
interact, having coding as the context of interaction. I have never had
that before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The single most important outcome of this experience was my
acculturation as a programmer. I learned best practices, terms (both
standard and jargon), the names of companies and services, and more
generally how to think and express myself within this culture. For the
first time I came to think of myself as a programmer. I was so keyed up
during the batch that I slept about five hours a night, and I dreamt of
coding on most nights whose visions I can remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have some sense now of the dimensions of the mind-space in which the
life of a coder is situated, as though I have become aware the height of
the unseen vaults overhead when I stand in a dark cathedral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The community has provided me many models for how to do things and how
to conduct myself as a programmer. I finally overcame the sloth that had
previously kept me from learning how to use Git and VirtualEnv, and
those things have led to better workflow hygiene all around — it has led
me to pay much more attention to my Python and Ubuntu installations, for
instance. I finally remembered to begin making regular use of list and
dictionary comprehensions in my code, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hacker School has provided far more chances for me to receive fruitful
criticism (Karl Popper's phrase) than I have ever gotten before on my
code or my thinking. The community is a sort of personal Stack Overflow,
without the insults or grubbing for votes, and that has been very
helpful. The use of [the internal chat client] Humbug [now renamed
&lt;a href="zulip.com" title="Zulip"&gt;Zulip&lt;/a&gt;, 20130813] greatly facilitated communication, including after
the batch, and think life would have been much harder if we had been
limited to IRC or Skype chat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other specific gains I'm aware of are, if not speed, then anyway "motor
memory" as it affects my proficiency with coding syntax and my choice of
tools. I have a long way to go yet but my progress these three months
has been greater than at any other time in my life as a coder. I have
become comfortable with SQLite3, BeautifulSoup4, Feedparser, and NLTK,
and am much more willing now to pick up a module I don't know and try to
learn how to use it. Now that the batch has been over for three weeks
and I am back to the insanity of my philological work — using chopsticks
to clear a room of swarms of gnats is what it's like — I constantly find
myself envisioning efficiencies and then building them or hunting for
tools rather than letting myself get into a rut doing things the same
way as before. That shows me that the grooves of my mind have indeed
been altered substantively by my experience these three months. I do not
feel quite right if several days go by without coding, either — I am
still making peace with that, as though after a religious experience
that demands changes in how I live.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Another two subway rules of thumb illustrated</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/another-two-subway-rules-of-thumb-illustrated.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-05-02T07:56:00-04:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2013-05-02:another-two-subway-rules-of-thumb-illustrated.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;​1. Sometimes it is more efficient to use an exit or stairway that is
not the closest one to your destination, if there are fewer people
taking it along with you. In that case, you can make up the distance
lost more quickly above ground than you would have managed if you had
gotten into a long, dense line below ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, these past three months I have been commuting to the
Houston Street station on the Seventh Avenue line. The King Street exit
is substantially closer to my destination than the main exit, so I
normally position myself in car 2, rear door, which is closest to the
platform's emergency exit there and to the stairway on the southwest
corner of the intersection. But if I have not made it into car 2 —
perhaps only into car 3, which is nearest to the turnstile-exits at King
Street, I will arrive at the south stairway too late to bound up it
unimpeded. It will be clogged with a mass of slow-moving commuters
trudging to jobs downtown from King Street, and I will have to slow my
speed to match them. I prefer to avoid trudging if I can. Instead, I
prefer to take the turnstile exit and then leave through the &lt;em&gt;north&lt;/em&gt;
stairway, which is usually much emptier at this time than the south
stairway. Once I'm on the street, I can cross King in the downtown
direction at normal Gotham Breakneck speed and be where I am going
before most of the people who took the south stairway ahead of me have
emerged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​2. Here is an example of striving to be second, rather than first, in a
tight situation (see also &lt;a href="http://brannerchinese.wordpress.com/2011/11/24/two-rules-of-thumb-about-transportation-in-new-york/"&gt;this previous post&lt;/a&gt;). At King Street I try
to be the second person out of the car, so that someone else can do the
technically illegal work of opening the emergency exit; this particular
emergency exit door is heavy and you generally need to push it once to
unlock it and again to make it swing open, and I prefer to leave all
that to the anxious person I choose to walk behind. Many people are in
an intensely competitive state of mind when leaving the train for their
jobs, and are happy to be the first ones to the door; this is the time
to hang back and let them clear the way for me. Once the door is open, I
can normally get up the south stairway well before them.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Short-circuiting and (and ==) instead of if in Python</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/short-circuiting-and-instead-of-if-in-python.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-05-01T15:02:00-04:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2013-05-01:short-circuiting-and-instead-of-if-in-python.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some people use a special short-circuiting &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; expression to replace
&lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; blocks in Python. For instance, instead of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; \&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;one can use&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; \&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The point is that because multi-term logical conditions are evaluated in
series, &lt;code&gt;f(x)&lt;/code&gt; is only evaluated after &lt;code&gt;x &amp;gt;= 0.5&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt;, making
&lt;code&gt;x &amp;gt;= 0.5&lt;/code&gt; a pre-condition of &lt;code&gt;f(x)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You cannot use an outright assignment (here &lt;code&gt;y = x&lt;/code&gt;) as the second part
of the &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; statement; only a function will do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, this syntax is unsatisfying to me because it is less
explicit than using &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; outright. But I've seen it defended by a gifted
programmer as being "explicit once you recognize the syntax", and I
wondered if there was any timing advantage to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of timing, on 10\^8 iterations, are (in seconds):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="mf"&gt;43.7663021088&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;44.545058012&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It doesn't look as though the &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; statement saves time, particularly.
I suspect it is a case of coding craftiness — surely a pleasurable thing
in itself. But it now seems clear to me that using &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; is better; it is
both explicit and involves no loss of speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Addendum&lt;/em&gt;, later in the evening:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is another way to use short-circuiting to avoid the use of &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt;:
with &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt;; for instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; \&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Just as with &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; causes &lt;code&gt;f(x)&lt;/code&gt; to be evaluated after &lt;code&gt;x &amp;gt;= 0.5&lt;/code&gt;;
we can show (though I have not done so here) that &lt;code&gt;f(x)&lt;/code&gt; is in fact
evaluated. But it turns out that this trick saves even less time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="mf"&gt;50.7892489433&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Best to stick with &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt;, it seems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program I wrote to compare processing times follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A certain man who was learning to shoot a bow aimed at the target with
two arrows in his hand. His teacher said, "A beginner should not hold
two arrows. It will make him rely on the second arrow and be careless
with the first. Each time you shoot you should think not of hitting or
missing the target but of making this one the decisive arrow." I
wonder if anyone with only two arrows would be careless with one of
them in the presence of his teacher. But though the pupil is himself
unaware of any carelessness, the teacher will notice it. This caution
applies to all things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A man studying some branch of learning thinks at night that he has the
next day before him, and in the morning that he will have time that
night; he plans in this way always to study more diligently at some
future time. How much harder it is to perceive the laziness of mind
that arises in an instant! Why should it be so difficult to do
something now, in the present moment?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see what is in front of one's nose needs a constant struggle. One
thing that helps toward it is to keep a diary, or, at any rate, to
keep some kind of record of one's opinions about important events.
Otherwise, when some particularly absurd belief is exploded by events,
one may simply forget that one ever held it. Political predictions are
usually wrong. But even when one makes a correct one, to discover
&lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; one was right can be very illuminating. In general, one is only
right when either wish or fear coincides with reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If one recognizes this, one cannot, of course, get rid of one's
subjective feelings, but one can to some extent insulate them from
one's thinking and make predictions cold-bloodedly, by the book of
arithmetic. In private life most people are fairly realistic. When one
is making out one's weekly budget, two and two invariably make four.
Politics, on the other hand, is a sort of sub-atomic or non-Euclidean
world where it is quite easy for the part to be greater than the whole
or for two objects to be in the same place simultaneously. Hence the
contradictions and absurdities I have chronicled above, all finally
traceable to a secret belief that one's political opinions, unlike the
weekly budget, will not have to be tested against solid reality.&lt;/p&gt;

over, with nine out of the twelve weeks past. Where do things stand with
me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've gained a great deal of concrete knowledge about programming. But
programming is a field of infinite domain. It is constantly growing, and
so concrete knowledge, while it is a central goal in my coming here,
doesn't represent a change of state within my mind. Growth of outlook is
rather the key question. And what has evolved the most in my outlook is
my relationship to this field, especially my shifting notion of how I
fit into it, unbounded though its domain may be. As a result of entering
Hacker School I have become more fully "socialized" as a programmer; as
of about the sixth week of the batch I have started to feel as though I
really am one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My knowledge of tools and practices has matured since I got here, as has
my ability to discuss programming lucidly and use terms that other
programmers recognize as sound ones. I'm much more tolerant of jargon
and conscious of the names of things — software, sites, coders,
approaches — that exist and are known to other people. All these things
are fixtures of the coding world and tokens of identity. My ability to
find efficiencies that can be imposed on an existing piece of code has
improved. I don't feel able to contribute to open-source projects yet
--- though I have the sensation that that will come fairly soon, another
important step forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much for changes to the scope of my outlook. What about the scope of
time in the learning process? I am not at a plateau yet. Plateaux are
important in the process of learning --- I would go so far as to hazard
that when we talk about "graduating", in relation to a course of study,
we are really saying "attaining a new 'grade' or plateau." I am not
ready to graduate yet in that sense. As it happens, one of the mottoes
of Hacker School is "never graduate". I take the point that this has to
do with the community's vision of itself as an unconventional place of
learning. But I think the same outlook is common among people who remain
in academia for long periods or for their working lives --- at least,
among people who pursue some branch of learning in which one has to face
the need for a division between study for its own sake and the
application of that study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a different sense, I feel that Hacker School will never end for me. I
don't know if I'll be admitted to a second batch or not --- I hope so,
but the decision is out of my hands and doesn't bear thinking about too
much. But I find I have been ushered into a frame of mind in which I see
my identity as a programmer to be legitimate and my pursuit of
programming skills and knowledge as basic to my well-being. The two
prime gifts that Hacker School confers are to have other programmers
nudge me constantly about my work, and to be in the presence of people
who are as hungry as I am to learn to program well. No matter what the
field, I am lucky to be around people like this at any time, and having
these particular surroundings is not fungible --- taking part in person
is essential and I can't imagine that a substitute could easily be
brought into being. But I foresee that even after I leave the Hacker
School environment, my frame of mind will continue to evolve in a way
that has been set in motion by what has happened to me here.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Nakamoto Satoshi, the name of Bitcoin's inventor</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/nakamoto-satoshi-the-name-of-bitcoins-inventor.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-04-14T14:15:00-04:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2013-04-14:nakamoto-satoshi-the-name-of-bitcoins-inventor.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I wonder if among the inventors of Bitcoin is someone who is thinking
about China. Bitcoin is supposed to have been invented by someone named
"Nakamoto Satoshi", but the name appears to contain a pun on "Chinese
currency".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This name, which is Japanese, is widely reported to be a pseudonym. Like
most Japanese names, it can be rendered into &lt;em&gt;kanji&lt;/em&gt; in a number of
different ways. What interests me is that among the written forms of
Nakamoto is 中元, which can mean 'Chinese &lt;em&gt;yuán&lt;/em&gt;' or 'Chinese currency'
(among other things). Satoshi means approximately 'sage' or 'enlightened
one' and is associated with dozens of different written forms — the full
name Nakamoto Satoshi could be read to mean "the wise one of Chinese
currency."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not recall having seen this observation made publicly before now.
But it occurred to me after receiving [this link to a Quartz article
about China's affinity for virtual currency][].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin is an implementation of "&lt;a href="http://www.weidai.com/bmoney.txt" title="Wei Dai's proposal for b-money"&gt;b-money&lt;/a&gt;", the work of the
cryptographer &lt;a href="http://www.weidai.com/" title="Wei Dai's website"&gt;Wei Dai&lt;/a&gt;. As of this writing, the &lt;a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin" title="Bitcoin (ビットコイン)"&gt;Japanese Wikipedia
site&lt;/a&gt; renders the whole name Nakamoto Satoshi as 中本哲史; on Chinese
sites it is generally 中本聪, apparently 'China [is] basically clever'.
Both of these renderings conceal the decoding that I am proposing.&lt;/p&gt;

School. They stir up different reactions in the mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code review involves putting forward a piece of work, in some state of
completion, and getting feedback on it if not large-scale suggestions
for refactoring, or even outright refactoring itself. Naturally I want
to look my best when showing my work to others for criticism. Even if it
would be better to be "egoless", as the faculty advise, taking extra
care is only to be expected and there's no point moralizing about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But pairing, in contrast — two minds driving just one pair of hands at
the keyboard — has got to be casual to be effective. Ideally, both
parties should be using the process as a chance to collaborate and learn
without pressure. Even if one party is very much more advanced than the
other, there is learning going on for both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, most of the pairing sessions I've had have not been very
casual. Today, a fellow student paired with me, meaning that he gave me
a tour of his project and then made a few simple changes to it while I
watched — it was all very easy-going and pleasant, but I sensed that he
was a little uncomfortable throwing himself into a more substantial task
in front of me, in which he might be stumped. I understand the
hesitation, of course; I feel the same way, but I recognize that this is
treating casual pairing as though it were a more "serious" code-review
event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same happened with the two "pairing" sessions I had with one of the
faculty last week and on Monday — she treated them as high level design
sessions with pen and paper, rather than just plain pairing with one of
us at the keyboard. Now, the sessions were an enormously helpful
experience for me, all around. They were not stressful at all, and they
enabled me to make a big step forward in the redesign of my project. But
even so, they were not really the egoless and casual experience that
pairing is supposed to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that to do plain, casual pairing is going to cost me a bit more
effort to bring into being, paradoxically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, I had one totally unplanned pairing experience at the end of
the day today. I approached a faculty member with a problem I couldn't
solve (how to unpack a list of lists in Python using a nested
comprehension rather than loops) and she was stumped by it for a while,
too. We tried a few different tactics but failed to solve it, in part
because of mistaken assumptions on my part or hers. Eventually she found
an "incantation" — a working solution that I think neither of us fully
understood at the moment — on StackOverflow. Afterwards, we gradually
made sense of why that solution worked, and came to considered the
problem fully solved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Here is a schematic of the solution:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;Out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This assumes the list of lists is only two levels deep.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;, I think, is a good example of how a successful pairing
encounter might turn out — joint pursuit of working code as well as a
grasp of why it works, without anyone being in charge, exactly, and both
parties learning from the experience. I've had a good week all around,
so far, but this was the high point. I want more of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know if I'm capable of egolessness, but this was certainly a
process unlike most of what I do at Hacker School — most of what I do is
driven by my own expression of self. This, on the other hand, was driven
merely by the desire to move forward an inch in writing a function, and
it ended up setting me forward a good yard — and perhaps it taught the
facilitator something, too. There was no pressure at all, and it was a
delight. I must find ways to make this happen much more often.&lt;/p&gt;

and what is happening to me at Hacker School. Seven of Hacker School's
twelve weeks are up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is Hacker School like graduate school? Well, it is not like a computer
science graduate program, because the emphasis is entirely on coding.
But it reminds me of an element of my time as a graduate student of East
Asian Studies in Seattle: particularly the close relationships that came
into being among the students in the rigorous sinology part of the
program. We studied together, crammed together, shared notes on how to
deal with various faculty, learned how to attend conferences, read each
other's work, and sat in on each other's dissertation defenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was not nearly so much closeness among the students of Chinese
linguistics proper, perhaps because there were fewer of us and
especially there were fewer really serious students among us. But among
the sinologists proper there has been a sense of clan-membership that
has lasted ever since those days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is a basic part of what graduate education ought to be — the
establishment of life-long relationships with other people in one's
field, as all of them make their peace with the culture of that field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have the sensation that that is what is underway at Hacker School,
too.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Why do I work so hard at Hacker School?</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/why-do-i-work-so-hard-at-hacker-school.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-03-28T13:21:00-04:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2013-03-28:why-do-i-work-so-hard-at-hacker-school.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A correspondent has asked why I am working so much more concentratedly
now that I am at Hacker School, whereas when I was at City College or
between semesters I was allowing myself to do a far greater variety of
tasks, including even socializing. I worked on book projects, organized
conferences and panels, helped people with various things they couldn't
get done on their own, and so on. And I wrote a number of papers and
reviews — even starting a major research project which I finished in six
weeks in the first half of the Fall semester. None of that seems
possible now — almost none — I suppose I did deliver a conference paper
earlier this month and I realize that I am teaching a class. But the
fact remains that almost all my time is spent on Hacker School work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No doubt it's the environment — having peers and supervisors who are
entitled to ask me at any time what I'm doing motivates me to work with
greater obduracy and to exclude everything else from my attention. The
motivation I feel in this environment is closer to what drives me when I
am preparing to publish an article or even a book, or to submit an
application essay somewhere — knowing that it will be received by other
people is stimulating, while when I code alone, even when doing a school
assignment, my state of mind is more like the way it is when doing
research — passage of time seems to impose less pressure on me when I am
not preparing to "speak" publicly with what I am composing.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Hacker School compared with studying computer science at City College</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/hacker-school-compared-with-studying-computer-science-at-city-college.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-03-26T00:09:00-04:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2013-03-26:hacker-school-compared-with-studying-computer-science-at-city-college.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Someone has asked what City College course-load I think the current

&lt;p&gt;My answer: there is no equivalent, because essentially all City College

substantial theoretical or mathematical content rather than intensive
coding. The stresses one undergoes in a coding-only curriculum are
different enough from a school curriculum that I have my doubts about

with writing prose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I've been thinking about ways in which this is not true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time&lt;/strong&gt;. When I write or polish English, I sometimes look up to
    find that far less time has passed in the world of the clock than in
    my mind. There is something about manipulating words in silence that
    slows my perception of time down to the speed of a slug. My sense of
    accomplishment — of time efficiently spent — is great at such a
    moment. And that is not what it feels like when I write, debug, or
    refactor code — on the contrary, the clock seems to have jumped an
    hour or two every time I look up from what I perceive to be a few
    minute's cognition.
    &lt;p&gt;
    Clearly very different processes are at work. I can imagine that
    habit is one factor; surely there are others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economy&lt;/strong&gt;. I find programming languages very different from
    natural language because of the redundancy of speech. In speech we
    often say the same thing several times in different (or even the
    same) words, and choose collocations in which the elements reinforce
    each other, which is also a kind of redundancy. Even the level of
    economy normally reached in writing is not possible in natural
    speech, to say nothing of the semantic density of a programming
    language.
    &lt;p&gt;
    Classical Chinese, in which (at its best) every morpheme contributes
    to the meaning of the whole sentence, has a density more like a
    programming language. But to me that has always suggested that
    Classical Chinese is not a close representation of oral language;
    rather, it must be a fundamentally written entity — never mind the
    presence of oral elements in it or its powerful effects on modern
    spoken language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-verbal elements&lt;/strong&gt;. Pseudocode often bears a likeness to
    natural language. But few if any programming languages are very much
    like pseudocode. The problem is the symbolic content — brackets of
    different kinds, disambiguating parentheses, different kinds of
    quotation marks, and so on. The same factors that put distance
    between mathematics and natural language apply in the case of
    programming languages. To unwind symbolic notation into words that
    can be understood on a single reading or hearing is often frankly
    impossible. It is a commonplace that the time frame within which one
    reads and understands a mathematical argument is orders of magnitude
    away from ordinary reading. The same is true of code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there are the complications that nesting, control flow, and
memory bring. Exams in first and second-semester computer science
courses often contain questions about the output of nested loops or
passing by reference, and interpreting even a simple code block
usually brings disaster to many students. Furthermore, once a
variable is declared and assigned, its type and content are "known"
to the computer till the end of the run. Who could imagine a
computer program full of statements addressing the listener or
reader as a human being with fallible memory — statements intended
to help clarify a fact in a long narrative? But such things abound
in natural language — here are three at random from Robert Graves's
&lt;em&gt;I, Claudius&lt;/em&gt;, written in a chatty style:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was at this point that my mother who, you must remember, was
Livilla's mother too, interposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pollio's son Gallus — hated by Tiberius because he had married
Vipsania (Tiberius's first wife, you will recall, whom he had been
forced to divorce on Julia's account), and because he had never
given a public denial of the rumour which made him the real father
of Castor, and because he had a witty tongue — this Gallus was the
only senator who had dared to question the propriety of the
motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He relieved Vonones of his treasure — you will recall that Vonones
was the former king of Armenia, about whom my brother Germanicus
had quarrelled with Gnaeus Piso — by sending agents to help him
escape from the city in Cilicia where Germanicus had put him under
guard and then having him pursued and killed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above all, natural language normally deals with words corresponding
directly to human experience. Even metaphor and other high-level natural
language abstractions do this. It is hard for me to imagine a
programming language dealing with human experience this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, I do not believe that human thought processes are rigorously
rational. We can sometimes emulate reason, but that is all we can do.
Natural language reflects that state of things. Specialized programming
languages may some day emulate human thought, but I am content with
Python or LaTeX attempting to do something very different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was prompted to write this by a conversation last night with Sean
McGovern of Hacker School.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Hacker School after six weeks</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/hacker-school-after-six-weeks.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-03-24T00:27:00-04:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2013-03-24:hacker-school-after-six-weeks.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Another week of Hacker School has passed and we are now at the halfway
mark. If I learn as much between now and the end as I have since I got
here, I'll be in a state of mind I can hardly imagine yet. I've been
well aware that my academic life has set me a very high bar for mastery
of ideas and methods, and that I am nowhere near being able to reach
that bar in programming. But I am not in a hurry, or more exactly I am
terribly eager to learn more and do so faster, but at the same time my
patience with the process is increasing as I gain a broader view of the
field before me. I try not to think of the vastness and depth of the
field in terms of my own scale, and that helps fertilize the growth of
patience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A moment for observing myself: While helping my dictionary coauthor
apply for promotion and then preparing a conference paper last weekend I
happened to re-run the code I wrote for these two substantial projects
in the Summer and Fall. And as result of that I took a good, fresh look
at the code and realized just how much I had learned in the first five
weeks of Hacker School, and how much I would do differently now. That
was quite a lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My chief reflection is that now, at the halfway point, Hacker School has
pushed aside almost everything else in my life. The only dreams I can
remember in the mornings are of writing and debugging code. I have
ceased to follow any coherent exercise plan, although I'm still doing my
150 squats while the others in the mid-afternoon pushup group are doing
pushups. I'm pretty sure I'm not getting enough sleep, but I still feel
too stimulated to try to get more. I haven't been getting written the
daily diaries I send to a few friends, and on Thursday I even failed to
keep my own internal record of tasks accomplished, although I did get a
lot of code written and a few additions made to my running list of
methods and tricks learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the recipients of my daily records, ever thoughtful, wrote to ask
about the place of drive in the Hacker School experience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm curious how much of the benefit of this experience is the result
of your commitment to set aside uninterrupted time for learning, how
much of it comes from being in an environment with others driven to
learn independently (and perhaps some competitiveness on your part in
such environments?), and how much of it comes from actual engagement
with peers who can assist you at key moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first thought is that I would not underestimate the level of
commitment and competitiveness among programmers among all levels,
including even novices who have not yet written a single working
program. As a matter of culture, Hacker School promotes the ideal that
we should avoid some of the roughness of explicit competitiveness, but
of course it's there in what drives many of us. I try to be gentle with
my peers and (in my other life as a teacher) my students, but I think
competitiveness is healthy, just as collaboration is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internal drives aside, the mixture of self-directed independent work and
"pairing" is key to the experience here. I could write about that for
several hours, but I don't feel the time for doing so has come yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should also mention the selection process through which my "batch" or
cohort entered Hacker School. The School's first two batches are said to
have been made up of friends and the friends of friends. But the
admission process has been more elaborate since then. I didn't find it
unpleasant or stressful in any way. The other day, over a meal with
three of my batch, I mused that there really is no one the least bit
unpleasant or uninteresting in this whole batch — and whatever
heuristics were applied internally by the faculty during
application-vetting and interviews, the results impress me. And I
consider myself well prepared to appreciate the effectiveness of this
process process, having hired and managed personnel and overseen
students in all sorts of different educational programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My inquiring friend continued:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A related thought would be: What percentage of your HaSch cohort seem
to feel the same as you about its rewards? If independent and
uninterrupted work is the key factor, since that is a rare skill, even
with the selection effects of opting into the school and being chosen,
I might expect that only a small number truly feel they are getting as
much benefit as you (although others might fool themselves).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is hard to gauge the state of things so as to answer conclusively in
a few words. Self-direction is a central part of the experience at
Hacker School. Some people seem to be coding socially much more of the
time than others, but I suppose that is a temperamental choice and there
is room for different styles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of our number have said that their learning and planning strategies
were poor in the first weeks — that they didn't use their time well or
even know what they should be doing. How things may have changed since
then I can't say. That would make an interesting topic for a survey
toward the end of the batch. But my view is that even a gross
miscalculation here doesn't derail self-direction; it provides new
opportunities to evaluate what one is doing and redirect oneself. And
evaluating oneself is the key thing, while never making foolish mistakes
is as good as impossible. So I don't take poor initial planning too
seriously — I don't consider it a damning error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anecdotally, everyone I have asked considers Hacker School an
exceptional adventure of growth and self-cultivation. Some people are
hoping to find work as a direct outcome of participation in the batch,
but not everyone by any means. That's a further complication in
answering questions about what drives people. And things are organized
so that the recruitment component of Hacker School has been discussed
very little in these past six weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Pairing at Hacker School</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/pairing-at-hacker-school.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-03-12T08:24:00-04:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2013-03-12:pairing-at-hacker-school.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm starting my second month at &lt;a href="http://hackerschool.com" title="Hacker School"&gt;Hacker School&lt;/a&gt;, a sort of ripening
cave for cheeses of the programmer variety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm hard put to sum up the experience in a few words, but I will say
that it has been the most intense episode of independent learning I have
had since my first year of fieldwork in China. (I found myself in the
mountains of Western Fújiàn without supervision and learned how to do
linguistic fieldwork by myself with real Chinese farmers and working
people in their own environment.) "Independent learning" does no justice
to it, though, because while I spend most of the day under my own
direction, in one respect it is as though I am in an apprenticeship —
albeit one whose terms are constantly shifting. There is a huge range of
knowledge among the 44 or so members of the current "batch", and I can
easily get advice or instruction on almost anything I have trouble with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More useful than advice or instruction, however, is constructive
prodding. Hacker School has a system for encouraging that, called
pairing. Pairing is when two people work "together" — on a single
computer, with only one person at the keyboard, but both involved in the
coding or whatever is being done. There is an element of dialectic,
negotiation, Talmudic disputation, or call it what you like from among
the familiar models of this kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our first day, a month ago, Nick Bergson-Shilcock spoke to us about
philosophy, and among his points was that “pairing” is the thing that
members of past batches most often say they wish they had done but
didn’t, or didn’t until too late. I'm feverishly self-directed by
temperament, and there were projects I knew I wanted to do, and to
conceptualize on my own. So I didn't exactly see how I would find a
comfortable way to start pairing. But it was "easiest" just to jump into
it rather than worrying about being comfortable. I've now had about half
a dozen pairing experiences and am fully sold on its utility. And on its
comfort, too — it's quite pleasurable, and the learning that happens in
the encounter extends deeper into my mind than if I pursue self-absorbed
work alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am confident I can learn anything, but the one thing I really lack is
experience. Yesterday I "apprenticed" myself to a far more proficient
programmer, volunteering to write two web applications for his use, to
save him some time in a project. In the end he substantially rewrote my
code, and for me that was a great gift — a chance to see a more expert
solution to a problem I had attempted, and to observe any number of
efficiencies and best practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Night sends me to bed tired but full of unspent emotional energy; in the
morning I find I have usually only had four or six hours of sleep but
have trouble restraining my drive to get back to work.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>The Norman Manchu dictionary has reached Seattle</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/the-norman-manchu-dictionary-has-reached-seattle.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-02-27T11:34:00-05:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2013-02-27:the-norman-manchu-dictionary-has-reached-seattle.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of my Shymuu 師母.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is my preface to the dictionary (with one typographical error
corrected in 五體清文鑑).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Editor's Preface&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerry Lee Norman (1936–2012) was born to Okies — Depression-era refugees
from the Dust Bowl of Oklahoma, who settled down as farm workers in
California. He was fascinated with language from childhood. Denied
permission to study Latin in school, he taught himself using an old
textbook, and soon knew so much that his school asked him to teach other
students. After a stint studying Chinese in the Army Language school,
and a year preparing for the priesthood in a Benedictine priory (one
recently transplanted to the United States from China), he finally
decided his calling was to study Chinese language and so matriculated as
an undergraduate at the University of California at Berkeley. At
Berkeley he studied linguistic field methods, Chinese, and Mongolian,
continuing into the doctoral program. He also attained a high level of
fluency in Russian during those years. Norman was the principal American
student of Yuen Ren Chao 趙元任 (1892–1982) in descriptive and
historical Chinese linguistics. He spent almost his whole teaching
career at the University of Washington, Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two years of his Fulbright grant in Taiwan, from 1965–67, were spent
largely on Manchu, even though he completed all the work for a
ground-breaking dissertation on Mǐn dialects of Chinese at the same
time. He told me the story in an interview in 2006:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got to Taiwan, they had in the office there a copy of the book
by Tulišen 圖理珅 (1667–1741), who was a Manchu official sent by the
Kāngxī Emperor to Russia in something like 1725. And he wrote an
account of his journey, which is really for intelligence purposes and
so forth, and very interesting — very repetitious but very
interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was working on that and I constantly was coming up against this
problem that there's no Manchu dictionary in English. So I would use
the Japanese &lt;em&gt;Manwa jiten&lt;/em&gt; 滿和辭典 (which also has Chinese glosses in
it, so that was quite usable). And I also had Erich Hauer's
&lt;em&gt;Handwörterbuch der Mandschusprache&lt;/em&gt;. But at least half the time I'd
look the Manchu up and then I had to go and look up the German words.
So at some point I just decided, well, why not — I have all this time,
you know — maybe I should compile my own dictionary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the first thing I did was cut up the Manchu-Japanese dictionary.
Since I had research funds, I had a blueprint copy made of it, printed
only on one side. I hired an assistant to cut all the entries out and
paste them on cards. At that time in Taiwan you couldn't buy cards;
you couldn't go to the stationery store and say "I want four-by-five
cards," or any size — you had to have them made. So we had a whole
bunch of cards made and pasted all the cut-outs onto the cards. And
then we had a great big file cabinet made, with drawers, and so we put
all the cards in there — it was in alphabetical order already. I would
go into the office, early in the morning, maybe beginning at 6:30 or
7:00, and I just went through the whole thing and translated it. I had
a Japanese gloss and a Chinese gloss probably from the &lt;em&gt;Wǔtǐ Qīng
wénjiàn&lt;/em&gt; 五體清文鑑 or something like that. The Japanese was
relatively simple; I could deal with most of that, with a dictionary.
And I had Hauer, and Hauer had more entries, so I sometimes added
entries that were in Hauer but weren't in the Japanese material. And
in working that way I finished the thing in about seven months — went
through all the cards in seven months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I got another assistant who typed it up as a manuscript and went
through, corrected things, and so forth, and then I made another copy
and had it printed in Taiwan — just purely privately; I paid for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was all done on a Fulbright to study Chinese! He added:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I had so much &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt;, you know. I'd never in my life had a period
when nobody told me to do anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What he produced in Taiwan was only the foundation of the present book.
He spent the next forty-five years refining and expanding it by reading
Manchu documents and consulting other materials, including recordings
and transcriptions of living Sibe 錫伯 that he made in Taiwan. (He
described his teacher in Taiwan, [Kongur] Kuang Lu [孔古爾] 廣祿,
1900–73, as a gifted extempore storyteller in the Sibe tradition.) An
initial edition of the dictionary was published in 1978, but the present
volume is considerably expanded from that, and also includes a guide to
pronunciation as Norman learned it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In later years, he had much help on this project from the members of a
Manchu study group based in Portland, Oregon, whom he names in his own
preface. In 2005, he asked me to begin helping him put it in order for
publication, which I have done using LaTeX (including the "multicol"
package, with gratitude to Frank Mittelbach). I am glad to acknowledge
the help of my mother, Shirley Branner — even though she knows no Manchu
or Chinese, she patiently read through the entire manuscript twice for
sense and correct order of entries. Most of the editing and typesetting
work was done in 2011 and 2012, with the very last corrections made to
the text on 28 June, 2012. Five days later, Prof. Norman entered the
hospital, and a few days after that he was gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerry Norman was a scholar of rare erudition, though retiring by
temperament. His memory for words and expressions, even in tongues he
did not know, left people floored. And few linguists I have known
possessed his true instinct for the workings of language. Beyond those
gifts, he was also a sincere and gentle person, whose willingness to
share what he knew touched many people far beyond his rather small
circle of students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norman's Manchu name was Elbihe, 'raccoon dog'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;​1. Having my name formally associated with a "hacker" organization has
mixed benefits. Among coders and technical people generally, the word
suggests inventive craftsmanship in the domain of programming, and the
name Hacker School itself already has a surprising amount of prestige.
At large, however, and especially in the media, "hacker" seems to mean
"cyberterrorist". There is not much room between these senses, and I can
imagine the disasters that might arise from misconstruals of this word,
especially willful misconstruals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​2. I've been completely independent in my research activities for as
long as I can remember — essentially since high school, when I started
trying to satisfy my curiosity in time cribbed from more "legitimate"
activities. Hacker School will force me to subject my coding activities,
including my own plans and strategies, to regular scrutiny by a number
of "facilitators" and "residents". Merely making my plans visible to
others will be quite a new experience for me, and I know it will take
some adjustment.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>The white powder on the pages of library books</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/the-white-powder-on-the-pages-of-library-books.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-02-09T00:21:00-05:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2013-02-09:the-white-powder-on-the-pages-of-library-books.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Around 2001 at the University of Maryland I started noticing that the
pages of library books now had white powder on them, something entirely
new in my long experience of using libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The powder came off on my hands when I turned pages, and since I didn't
know what it was, it greatly changed my relationship with library books.
I no longer handle library books in bed. After handling a library book
for half an hour or so I normally wash my hands — having any perceptible
substance on my hands makes it hard for me to study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This powder is magnesium oxide, whose alkaline and desiccant properties
are apparently intended to slow the disintegration of wood-pulp paper,
in which acid forms through the breakdown of lignin.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Non-math uses of LaTeX</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/non-math-uses-of-latex.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-02-08T17:06:00-05:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2013-02-08:non-math-uses-of-latex.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Now that I'm no longer dealing with math very much, I suspect the main
uses I expect to have for LaTeX are for documenting code — I have found
the &lt;code&gt;listings&lt;/code&gt; package most useful for for this — and for dealing with
Chinese text — &lt;code&gt;xeCJK&lt;/code&gt; is the best tool I have for Chinese typesetting
right now, and it seems to be under active development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great utility of LaTeX for me as a coder is being able to format
output from database dumps, to PDF. For the web, of course, normal HTML
tools will do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Journals in the humanities with which I have regular contact do not, on
the whole, seem ready to accept articles composed in LaTeX.&lt;/p&gt;

building personal relationships before the madness of meeting 50 new

edges ahead of time seems a useful preparation for learning the whole
order(2\^6) graph at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A returning member of batch[4] invited us to meet at Union Hall, a bar
in Brooklyn. It was a longish trek for me and I couldn't set out until I
had finished with the course I am teaching. But I did get there, and
after the usual unpleasantness trying to interact in a dark place with
noise all around, the group of perhaps eight or ten of us settled in a
quieter nook. Then it was possible to have mostly audible conversations
and even to see the expressions of the people who were speaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm impressed at how interesting and pleasant everyone seems to be. And
I got home well after three. Very glad I went — eight to ten people is
still a manageable number to meet at one time.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Hacker School (dojo/recruiter for programmers) begins in four days</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/hacker-school-dojorecruiter-for-programmers-begins-in-four-days.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-02-07T02:44:00-05:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2013-02-07:hacker-school-dojorecruiter-for-programmers-begins-in-four-days.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My stint in the sixth "batch" of &lt;a href="http://hackerschool.com"&gt;Hacker School&lt;/a&gt; begins on 11
February, four days hence. I anticipate three months of intense growth
as a programmer, and "reticulation" with a great many interesting souls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hacker School is not a school but a dojo for programmers at all levels.
It also functions as a recruiter for the lively tech industry in New
York. I know much less about it today than I expect to next week or in
the summer, but these two facts are clear. And both make it seem an
experience not to be missed. I have been studying Computer Science
part-time at City College for three years and have just finished the six
courses making up the undergraduate minor — Hacker School appears to be
an ideal next step for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I submitted an application as soon as the current competition opened and
was interviewed twice for it, each time by just one person: first, I had
what seemed to me an interview exploring my personality and public
voice, and not long after that, one dealing more directly with coding.
Neither was in any way stressful. Both interviewers had conversation
styles that invited me to listen and to speak, and both seemed attentive
to what I had to say. The interviews took place over Skype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the coding interview I had sent HaSch a little progress-bar class I
had written quickly in Python at the end of June and early July, just
after the &lt;a href="http://brannerchinese.wordpress.com/2012/02/22/manchu-dictionary-done/" title="Manchu dictionary done"&gt;Manchu dictionary was done&lt;/a&gt; and while &lt;a href="http://brannerchinese.wordpress.com/2012/07/16/jerry-norman-1936-2012/" title="Jerry Norman (1936–2012)"&gt;my teacher was in
his brief last illness&lt;/a&gt;. It had been my first foray into what passes
for multiprocessing in Python. I had left the project, I recalled, in a
working but highly inefficient state and I thought it would be a good
subject for a refactoring session, which is what the second interview
was supposed to dance around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About half an hour before the interview I decided to make sure the code
actually worked. It did not. So rather than going calmly into a
refactoring session, I was in high debug-mania when the interview
started. By then I had already identified and fixed two principal bugs,
and my mania had helped me to review the details of the code far better
than I had managed just by reading over it a few times on the subway.
The conversation was fun, and I knew I would be lucky — really graced —
to be accepted, if only for the pleasure of working with my interviewer
again. The original plan had been to work on the code using
&lt;a href="http://PiratePad.net"&gt;PiratePad&lt;/a&gt; (a site that allows synchronized text-editing by multiple
users), but the interviewer and I conducted the whole discussion by
voice, each of us looking at the same code on our separate machines. It
couldn't have gone more smoothly, and she left me with a good question
to ponder about my project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was notified of my admission before the end of the day of the second
interview, and rather than being excited I felt intense gratitude for
the invitation to be part of this unusual project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practice seems to be to refer to batches using array-index notation:
batch 6 is called "batch[5]".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applications closed on 22 January, a week later than advertised. A
mailing list was set up the same day, and threads quickly opened on
housing, insurance, and self-introductions. I suspect interviews
continued for some days after that, but recently we were told there were
45 of us in the current batch. We've heard that an introductory document
is in the works, but apart from a somewhat stern reminder not to be
obnoxious ("lightweight social rules" — "no subtle sexism" is perhaps
the least lightweight of them, considering HaSch's mission to guide more
women into the aggressive world of coding), nothing of a general nature
has materialized — do I sound as though I'm complaining? there's no
rush, of course. The organization has, for the first time, found
semi-permanent space for itself near the Canal Street station of the
West Side IRT, which will speed my commute. I can see that a lot of work
is going on behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past eight days I've met five other members of this batch
one-on-one, each for long enough to talk about serious things and get a
good taste of their temperaments. All seem to me to invite more of my
time in conversation. One is only minimally experienced at coding.
Another has a coding background not far from mine — experienced, but not
very, and in need of more intensive exposure. And the remaining three
have been working for some years as developers. I suppose these are the
three main types of background I will encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have thought hard about what sorts of projects to work on over these
three months. Although many of the advanced batchlings seem to be
interested in working through an on-line algorithms course or in Clojure
and other functional languages, I feel the need to get more practice at
tools I have already been exposed to but have not used extensively. As a
teacher I always place proficiency as my highest goal, and if I had one
disappointment in my City College education it was that proficiency — in
math and in coding — was not first among the program's goals for me. I
originally mentioned "more practice with familiar tools" in my initial
interview, when asked what I might spend my time on, but now after
considering the alternatives named by other people I feel much surer
that doing this is the best plan for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will aim for greater mastery of the whole web-dev/SQL/scraping stack
surrounding Python. As of today, I envision starting by building a
scraper feeding a simple SQL database, then rebuilding my
http://yintong.info site using Python and PostgreSQL (as I have long
wanted to do), and finally building a more elaborate NLP project
featuring web-scraped Chinese sentences and a parser. If I can get these
three projects running smoothly with time to spare, it would be
interesting to build parallel versions in some second language, such as
Ruby, which is so popular in New York right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I hope I am ready for unexpected changes in direction, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have prepared a VirtualBox installation of Ubuntu 12.04 server as my
working environment, and am hurrying to get an old MoinMoin wiki
restored for use as an on-line notebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's my intention to record my impressions of this experience on this
blog, too.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Dependencies for scipy and matplotlib not handled by pip</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/dependencies-for-scipy-and-matplotlib-not-handled-by-pip.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-01-07T11:58:00-05:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2013-01-07:dependencies-for-scipy-and-matplotlib-not-handled-by-pip.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;code&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt; to install almost all Python-based software on Ubuntu
(currently 12.04 LTS), but have had persistent problems with &lt;code&gt;scipy&lt;/code&gt;,
whose installation always fails after a long installation process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The logs are tedious, but the nub of the problem is that there are two
dependencies not being met by &lt;code&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt; because they are not Python-based:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;FORTRAN&lt;/code&gt;: "Formula Translator"; what is needed is a compiler for
    the familiar scientific programming language of the 1960s and 70s;
    install &lt;code&gt;gfortran&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;apt-get&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;BLAS&lt;/code&gt;: "Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms", a library for handling
    linear algebra and other scientific programming problems; install
    &lt;code&gt;libatlas-base-dev&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;apt-get&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After installation with &lt;code&gt;apt-get&lt;/code&gt;, pip is able to install &lt;code&gt;scipy&lt;/code&gt; and
its Python-based dependencies without incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it is preferable to use &lt;code&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt; in order to get current builds,
rather than turning to the standard Ubuntu packages, which sometimes
fall behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, there are dependencies for &lt;code&gt;matplotlib&lt;/code&gt; that must be
handled by &lt;code&gt;apt-get&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;libpng&lt;/code&gt;: library for handling PNG files; use &lt;code&gt;libpng12-dev&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;libjpeg&lt;/code&gt;: library for handling JPG files; use &lt;code&gt;libjpeg-dev&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;libfreetype&lt;/code&gt;: library for rendering fonts and bitmaps; use
    &lt;code&gt;libfreetype6-dev&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, you should be able to install &lt;code&gt;matplotlib&lt;/code&gt; smoothly with
&lt;code&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>The National Do Not Call Registry no longer works well</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/the-national-do-not-call-registry-no-longer-works-well.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-12-24T08:32:00-05:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2012-12-24:the-national-do-not-call-registry-no-longer-works-well.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been on the Do Not Call Registry since it was founded and have made
sure to re-register periodically. My judgment is that it no longer works
as well as it once did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It worked for a while. At first, the drop in the number of telemarketer
calls was impressive. And I suppose the registry is useful to the
government for mining purposes, and that is a motive to maintain it,
even if it doesn't work perfectly for its stated purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I work at home and now get, typically, half a dozen unwanted calls a day
on my landline. (Cell phone abuse has not yet started in earnest.) If
I'm angry enough I report these calls on the Registry's site, but that
takes me away from my work for longer. If I've been tricked into
answering, sometimes I tell the callers, "Take me off your list; it is
against the law for you to be calling me." They normally hang up before
I've even finished that sentence. But the calls continue. Letters about
this to my elected representatives have not been effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The registry no longer works well — I suppose it does work; I'm still
getting fewer calls than I did before the law went into effect. But it
isn't working as well as it once did. Some calls are from energy
providers, who seem to be allowed to trawl for business under the law.
But others are not. There are companies wanting to help me fix my
Windows computer — something I do not possess — and fake charities. Some
organizations (and some individual voices I can recognize) call
repeatedly. Before elections, the calls increase — not only political
survey companies, but people who want me to buy something or give them
money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My unlisted phone number has, after years not being findable on the web,
is now posted there by someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have caller ID, but many telemarketers use spoofed ID numbers. And
there are calls I want to receive — from friends with blocked numbers or
from relatives overseas — that don't show any ID or that show a
misleading one, so called ID is not a whole solution to the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, having a landline is still a security, and I intend to maintain
it as long as I can. As with other forms of spam — the email, the
web-based, and the interpersonal — one uses a combination of
prophylactics and poisons to get the job done. No one medicine prevents
all disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been cleaning up an old laptop that still has a phone jack in it,
hoping to get it to run a sufficiently current version of Python for me
to set the computer up as a phone-call interceptor.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Early evidence of a dislike of Christmas music?</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/early-evidence-of-a-dislike-of-christmas-music.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-12-17T10:47:00-05:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2012-12-17:early-evidence-of-a-dislike-of-christmas-music.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;What other sort of book could Catullus be talking about here?

&lt;p&gt;I am glad to see that Pliny the Younger didn't like Saturnalia/Christmas
any more than I do; like me, he preferred a quiet study environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I retire to this garden summer-house, I fancy myself a hundred
miles away from my villa, and take especial pleasure in it at the
feast of the Saturnalia, when, by the licence of that festive season,
every other part of my house resounds with my servants' mirth: thus I
neither interrupt their amusement nor they my studies.&lt;/p&gt;

(http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/gridview.html,
accessed 20121212) there is sample code to illustrate basic use of the
&lt;code&gt;GridView&lt;/code&gt; layout. Since layouts are the foundation of Android code,
they are useful for study at the outset of learning to write for the
platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;gridview.html&lt;/code&gt; page seems to date from "09 Dec 2012 21:51", but the
code does not run on Eclipse (Juno 4.2, service release 1, build ID
20121004-1855; Android SDK 4.1.2) as written. Below are my notes on
changes necessary to make it run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The code provides the content for &lt;code&gt;res/layout/main.xml&lt;/code&gt;, but by
    default Eclipse now names this file &lt;code&gt;activity_main.xml&lt;/code&gt;. Choose one
    or the other and make sure it is referred to consistently throughout
    the code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The code provides a &lt;code&gt;HelloGridView.java&lt;/code&gt; class containing an
    &lt;code&gt;onCreate()&lt;/code&gt; method, but by default Eclipse now places the skeleton
    of that method in a class called &lt;code&gt;MainActivity.java&lt;/code&gt;, not mentioned
    Google's tutorial. I recommend placing the content of Google's
    &lt;code&gt;onCreate()&lt;/code&gt; method into the skeleton generated by Eclipse. If,
    instead, you choose to name your class &lt;code&gt;HelloGridView.java&lt;/code&gt; and to
    delete &lt;code&gt;MainActivity.java&lt;/code&gt;, then you must remember to edit the
    &lt;code&gt;AndroidManifest.xml&lt;/code&gt; file accordingly; that is where the
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;application ... &amp;lt;activity ... / &amp;gt; &amp;lt;/application&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; entry names the
    class of the project's main activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The code prescribes a &lt;code&gt;/res/drawable&lt;/code&gt; directory, but you will have
    to create that; Eclipse currently creates only &lt;code&gt;/drawable-hdpi&lt;/code&gt;,
    &lt;code&gt;/drawable-ldpi&lt;/code&gt;, etc. directories in &lt;code&gt;/res&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eclipse will supply &lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt; statements for all recognized methods
    in importable classes if you press CTRL-SHIFT-O (or CMD-SHIFT-O on a
    Mac keyboard). But if &lt;code&gt;import android.R;&lt;/code&gt; is supplied as a result,
    you may find errors being raised on lines calling the automatically
    generated &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; class. If so, delete or comment out the line
    &lt;code&gt;import android.R;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's likely that the sample code on Google's site will be updated before
long, but in the past month there seems to have been a gap between the
posted code and what is needed to run (and be studied) on the current
Eclipse installation.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>A small triumph of explicitly readable code</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/a-small-triumph-of-explicitly-readable-code.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-12-06T20:44:00-05:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2012-12-06:a-small-triumph-of-explicitly-readable-code.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently I was asked to write an implementation of FizzBuzz*, a new
notion to me. I took, I suppose, a quarter of an hour and put together a
little Python program — it worked, and I felt clever because I had found
two little time-saving tactics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;taking care of the cases in order of how frequently they crop up
    (unmarked cases account for 8 in every 15; the "Fizz" case is 4 in
    15, "Buzz" is 2 in 15, and the co-occurrence "FizzBuzz" is 1 case in
    15);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;taking care of the FizzBuzz case as a subset of the Fizz case.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I submitted the code yesterday and went to sleep feeling good. This
morning, however, I started to wonder how many different implementations
there might be, since the basic idea is not terribly complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, there are large numbers of implementations, and I was impressed to
see how many crafty one-liners people have come up with. I studied a few
of them and learned a thing or two. Although I classify myself as a fox
on the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hedgehog_and_the_Fox"&gt;Archilochan dichotomy&lt;/a&gt;, my mind is slower than other people's,
and it is my weakness as a programmer always to write as simply and
explicitly as I can. When I see craftiness at work, after the initial
envy subsides, I always feel I'll never catch up to it, although I
usually then try to untangle what the experts have created, for my own
education. I timed the various implementations, too, and mine came out
far and away the slowest (results in seconds):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;iterations&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="mi"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dpb&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;at&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mh"&gt;0x1107791b8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.00968&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tamurakoichi&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;at&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mh"&gt;0x110779320&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.00067&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;anonymous&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;at&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mh"&gt;0x110779398&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.00144&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;smog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;at&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mh"&gt;0x110779410&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.00158&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;chrisclark&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;at&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mh"&gt;0x110779488&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.00181&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;jefallbright&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;at&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mh"&gt;0x110779500&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.00158&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;anonymous2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;at&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mh"&gt;0x110779578&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.00072&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;anonymous4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;at&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mh"&gt;0x1107795f0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.00171&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So much for the advantages of writing clear, explicit code!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then I looked a little more closely, and saw that most of these
faster methods assembled the whole output as a string or array first,
and then printed it all at once. I had been printing each line at a
time, surely an expensive luxury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I rewrote all the implementations to generate an output-string
without sending it to the console.** That allowed me to compare the
results, string to string, and gave me a more equable basis for timing
comparisons. And the results now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;iterations&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="mi"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dpb&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;at&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mh"&gt;0x10a729230&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.00018&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tamurakoichi&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;at&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mh"&gt;0x10a729668&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.00021&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;My painfully explicit code is also the fastest of the implementations
I've examined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I feel a little better now. Readable code is vindicated!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

an exceptionally beautiful piece of poetry, visual and musical. The DVD
contains an "extra" called "Essence of Life" (2002), which features
extended discussion by the directory, Godfrey Reggio, and the composer,
Philip Glass. It is well worth watching — far more instructive than most
director commentaries or "making of" documentaries. Here are a few
comments from the director:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my life, I entered a religious community of men at the age of 14,
stayed till the age of 28, grew up in effect in the middle ages, which
was remarkably insane and beautiful all at the same time — in other
words, it wasn't bad or good; it was bad and good at the same time,
this and that. And I felt it gave me a special preparation for life.
The part of it I was in prepared me to live a life of humility and
service and prayer, and that certainly goes against the grain of, say,
1950s New Orleans culture...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've always been, I guess, interested and motivated in what stands
behind the surface of things. And when you're religious and doing
meditation and mental prayer, and trying to go beyond words into some
deep feeling with something that's willful, then it helps you prepare.
I guess I had a great preparation for discipline and focus in that mad
time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I tried to show is that the main event today is not seen by those
of us that live in it. We see the surface of the newspapers, the
obviousness of conflict, of social injustice, of the market, welling
up of culture. But to me the greatest event, the most important event
of perhaps our entire history — nothing comparable in the past — this
event has fundamentally gone unnoticed. And this event is the
following: the transiting from old nature, or the natural environment,
as our host of life for human habitation, into a technological milieu,
into mass technology as the environment of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not that we &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt; technology; we &lt;em&gt;live&lt;/em&gt; technology. Technology
has become as ubiquitous as the air we breathe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life unquestioned is life lived in a religious state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is plenty more of interest in the interview extra, and the movie
itself was a superb experience.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Max Weber: "science is the affair of an intellectual aristocracy" (1918)</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/max-weber-science-is-the-affair-of-an-intellectual-aristocracy-1918.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-12-05T09:17:00-05:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2012-12-05:max-weber-science-is-the-affair-of-an-intellectual-aristocracy-1918.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Max Weber, in "Science as a Vocation":&lt;/p&gt;

being able to test the initial piece of sample code supplied by Google,
I ran into two problems that took many hours to solve. Below are the
solutions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​1. [posted to http://stackoverflow.com/a/13548213/621762] Initially
Google's code would not run, so I updated Eclipse. That led to the error
“Dex Loader SecurityException: Unable to find field for dex.jar”. There
was no obvious difficulty with the upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After many partial measures, it took the following to get the error to
go away:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;deleting both the Tools and current Android API installation, using
    the Android SDK Manager (followed by reboot);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;deleting the original directory in my filesystem containing the
    Android SDK files;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;downloading a fresh version of the Android SDK files
    (http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) and specifying its
    location in filesystem to Eclipse in Preferences=&gt;Android;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;installing fresh versions of both the Tools and current Android API,
    using the Android SDK Manager (followed by reboot)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder if there is something buggy in the regular updating protocol.
If updates go wrong again, I will try this full uninstall and reinstall
of the SDK files and ADT Plugin from the outset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​2. The emulator was extremely slow, so I tried connecting my two
Android devices (Android OS v. 2.3.4 = API 10, v. 4.0.3 = API 15) to my
computer and "registering" them with Eclipse's Android Device Chooser.
One has to turn on USB debugging on the phones, but this alone did not
make registration possible; neither did rebooting the phones.
Registration was possible only after rebooting my Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's strange to say, but I often find that whatever software problems I
am having evaporate near the end of the time I have allotted to work on
them. Tonight, as many times before, hours of frustration ended rather
suddenly a few minutes before midnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't understand this phenomenon, but am getting used to it. Getting a
little used to it — I never believe it's going to happen again until it
does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hardware and software involved:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mac OS 10.8.2 on 11-inch MacBook Air, Late 2010&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eclipse Version: Juno Service Release 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build id: 20121004-1855&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Android tools: 21.0.0.v201210310015-519525&lt;/li&gt;

my way through the Android training tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am moved to reflect that some people assume technology will solve all
their problems, but that I am not one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, technology embodies and concentrates all the qualities of the
human congener — it has wonderful potential, but anything may go wrong
with it. Even though I know that, I am always disturbed when I find
subtle (or gross) discrepancies between published descriptions and
actual function, even though my working model of the universe takes it
as a premise that such discrepancies abound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here
(http://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/creating-project.html),
on day 1 of my studies, I find that the New Android App window in
Eclipse is supposed to contain a "Build SDK" item. Well, there is no New
Android App window in my copy of Eclipse — there is a New Android
Application window. And on it there is no "Build SDK" item. There are
more items than are shown in the tutorial, and one of them ("Compile
With") is probably equivalent, but the literal item named for me to look
for is missing. The tutorial has not been kept current. I can tell now
that, at some point in the future, it is going to lead me into outright
error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, my working model of the universe takes that as a premise, so who
am I to complain? Causality proceeds as if following hashes in a hash
table — you yourself can't usually tell where a given hash will take you
just by inspection, but it does take you there, unfailingly. The problem
is that when you are given a roadmap showing a subtly different hash
than the one in the roadmap, there is no telling how far off you may end
up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I am proceeding anyway, in the state of mind I call "black
optimism": I expect the worst, but am confident I'll get through it even
so.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Talking across the pre- and post-computer border</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/talking-across-the-pre-and-post-computer-border.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-11-21T18:26:00-05:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2012-11-21:talking-across-the-pre-and-post-computer-border.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am working hard to finish a book project of my mother's.

gone, but I observe that many of us are not happy with the new
situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lifetime employment and the loyalty between company and worker are gone.
Privacy on the street and in one's communications are gone — basically,
anywhere anyone can hear or catch a glimpse of you, as well as on the
internet and in your record as a consumer. The idea of sportsmanship and
physical self-cultivation seems to have been replaced by chemicals —
boy, is that ever not the Greek ideal! And universities have ceased to
be institutions dedicated to selfless learning but have been replaced by
corporate zombies of similar appearance. This last change has been
underway since, to hear older professors talk, the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;

find a liveable situation of some sort.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Anything less than perfect is a failing grade</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/anything-less-than-perfect-is-a-failing-grade.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-11-13T12:18:00-05:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2012-11-13:anything-less-than-perfect-is-a-failing-grade.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently I bought a used book from a bookstore on line — I found it
through BookFinder.com. My book arrived with reasonable dispatch and in
the same condition it was advertised as. Since everything was
satisfactory, I thought no more about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But today I've received a letter from the store's management asking me
to leave feedback about them on the Amazon website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was surprised, since Amazon had no involvement in my order with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I was still more surprised at this request:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that we consider anything less than five star feedback to
be a failing grade, so please get in touch with us if there are any
problems to be resolved that we don't know about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidently in the service economy, customers have to be coached as to how
to evaluate a business, so that the business's marketing needs are met
properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am used to students writing to say they want an A or A+ and will work
as hard as necessary to get one. And I am well aware of my own
grievously arrogant perfectionism in my studies — which has the benefit
of motivating me but also the pitfall of making me want to quit if I
can't reach my ideals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until this morning, I had thought of these cases as character flaws —
entitlement or vanity. It's a new thought to me that my students and I
may also be practicing a kind of marketing spin.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Recovering from hurricane Sandy</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/recovering-from-hurricane-sandy.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-11-01T13:56:00-04:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2012-11-01:recovering-from-hurricane-sandy.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;There was nominal mail delivery yesterday, but almost nothing in

a stretch of about four miles south of the George Washington Bridge
along the Palisades Cliffs, visible from my window. No, that's not true:
car lights are visible, and here and there there is what is clearly
light from a generator in a single building. For another 2-1/2 miles
south of this stretch there are only streetlights visible on clifftop
(the river's edge is dark). Many people are going out to cafés for
internet service or using outdoor power jacks to charge their phones and
laptops, and then heading home to use them. I'm in touch with people
living that way right now. (I pay the price of a simple landline and
have an old phone connected directly to it — these things are powered
directly by the phone company, so you always have service.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Car traffic is heavier than usual outside my window and there have been
more people than usual on the street. In my immediate neighborhood more
than half the restaurants were open and packed with customers yesterday.
The subways will be down for, we hear, another 4-7 days. And some of the
tunnels under the East River are flooded and may be weeks or months away
from useability. But the bridges are all right and partial bus service
started yesterday afternoon; more began overnight. Columbia closed for
two days but will open today — but half my students are too far from
campus to attend class tomorrow, and I am moving to a partly on-line
teaching arrangement for the short term. City College, many of whose
students live in other boroughs, will remain closed today, and since it
is being used for emergency housing for evacuees, I'm not sure when it
will open or, when it does open, when students and instructors will be
able to get to campus in strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only by strict specialization can the scientific worker become fully
conscious, for once and perhaps never again in his lifetime, that he
has achieved something that will endure. A really definitive and good
accomplishment is today always a specialized accomplishment. And
whoever lacks the capacity to put on blinders, so to speak, and to
come up to the idea that the fate of his soul depends upon whether or
not he makes the correct conjecture at this passage of this manuscript
may as well stay away from science. He will never have what one may
call the 'personal experience' of science. Without this strange
intoxication, ridiculed by every outsider; without this passion, this
'thousands of years must pass before you enter into life and thousands
more wait in silence' — according to whether or not you succeed in
making this conjecture; without this, you have no calling for science
and you should do something else. For nothing is worthy of man as man
unless he can pursue it with passionate devotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does one engage in doing something that in reality never comes,
and never can come, to an end?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[To] set to work and meet the 'demands of the day,' in human relations
as well as in our vocation … is plain and simple, if each finds and

environments and commands. I have begun exploring it in the hopes of
extracting the footnotes of my father's book, in order to make a unified
bibliography of all the citations. I discovered while proofreading the
various citations that there were errors in them — they all date from
decades before the Internet, and there is no efficient way to check them
without combining them into a single list first. But by hand that would
be a lot of tiresome work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is the bare-bones description of the package from the full
documentation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following provides an example of the user interface of the package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;\usepackage&lt;/span&gt;[
    active,
    generate=file,
    extract-env=&lt;span class="nb"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;figure,table&lt;span class="nb"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    ]&lt;span class="nb"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;extract&lt;span class="nb"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the active option is not specified (or set to false), the package
does nothing and active no files are generated. If the option is
specified, the package will redefine the environments figure and table
so that they write their bodies (the content of the environment) to
the file indicated with the generate option, here &lt;code&gt;file.tex&lt;/code&gt;,
including the &lt;code&gt;\begin{figure}&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;\end{figure}&lt;/code&gt; commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… This package can also extract commands. It supplies two methods to
do this. See the extract-cmd example below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;\usepackage&lt;/span&gt;[
    active,
    generate=file,
    extract-cmd=section,
    extract-cmdline=label
    ]&lt;span class="nb"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;extract&lt;span class="nb"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first method (accessed with the &lt;code&gt;extract-cmd&lt;/code&gt; option) is based on
the particular syntax of the command and hence only supports
particular commands. It will read it arguments and write them,
together with the original command, to the target file. … The second
method (accessed with the &lt;code&gt;extract-cmdline&lt;/code&gt; option) will redefine
commands to write themselves and all the text following on the same
line to the target file and will also execute the entire line as with
an ordinary LaTeX run. This allows to redefine any command that is not
supported by the first method, but should be applied with care.&lt;/p&gt;

court order. Last night, the police stationed big electric signs up and
down Broadway saying "BWAYBOMB SKATEBD EVENT" ... "CANCELED BY COURT
ORDER" ... "SUBJECT TO ARREST". This morning they set up barricades here
and there and a big black loudspeaker on 116th St. with the same
message. There were at least 50 uniformed police, most standing around
looking dubious, and even some of their white collar overlords, more
poker-faced. And there were many dozens of people with skateboards
milling around — some angry and saying defiant things to each other. A
very large crowd formed on the east side of Broadway, at the Columbia
gates. A lot of people were recording events with phones, helmet cams,
and professional equipment. Orange police netting was being set up here
and there, but it was easy to walk around them — they were not hermetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was on the street to get lunch — I have two big projects and only
enough time to do one of them, and a store-bought lunch is part of my
solution to the pressure today (the other is Kyrgyz music.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right around noon a big cheer went up, the skateboarders headed down
116th St. to Riverside Drive, and simply got on their skateboards and
sailed downtown. The police — including the poker-faced ones — made no
effort to stop them, but actually waved them officially along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten minutes later, all is quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city has not been the same since September 11th. But with enough of
the right sort of irreverence, it may yet return to normal — to its own
healthy chaos. Kyrgyz music helps, too.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Does Apple view an "iPhone" phone number as something different from a "mobile" phone number?</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/does-apple-view-an-iphone-phone-number-as-something-different-from-a-mobile-phone-number.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-10-13T23:12:00-04:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2012-10-13:does-apple-view-an-iphone-phone-number-as-something-different-from-a-mobile-phone-number.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am looking at Apple's "Contacts" application in OS 10.8, formerly the
"Address Book".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the default fields for phone numbers — "work" and
"mobile" — there is now a third field "iPhone" that appears in edit mode
whenever both "work" and "mobile" are filled. If you click on this
"iPhone" label and select something else from the menu instead, then
your change is retained but as soon as your new field is filled, the
window is immediately repopulated with an additional "iPhone" field. I
don't see a simple way to make the iPhone label disappear from the edit
window. It is not present in the record template (accessible as a pane
in the preferences), but it appears whenever you edit a record and
follow the steps I have described.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is hard to understand what the people responsible for doing this
imagine Apple's relationship is to the users of its products. Evidently
I am supposed to view an iPhone as something different from a mobile
phone, and make a note when my contacts have an iPhone rather than some
other brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope the company undoes this piece of overweening self-promotion soon.
It is a most unwelcome marketing intrusion into my working space. To
call it offensive does not sufficiently reflect the strength of my
feelings.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Columbia University Libraries finally removing the card catalog</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/columbia-university-libraries-finally-removing-the-card-catalog.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-09-10T12:59:00-04:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2012-09-10:columbia-university-libraries-finally-removing-the-card-catalog.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;27 years after the great card catalog of the Columbia Libraries stopped
being updated, it is finally being removed altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The card catalog was a powerful reference resource in itself; its index
cards bore carefully researched information to help identify places and
subjects, authors and their dates, and innumerable bibliographic details
that were sometimes not apparent even when one had the book in one's
hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message that was received by Columbia faculty this morning, and
which is apparently not yet on line, reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fall you will begin to see changes in Butler Library, Room 310 as
the Libraries begin the process to remove the card catalog. The
Subject catalog in the north end of the room, overlooking College
Walk. will be removed in 2013, followed by sections of the Name/Title
catalog in 2014. We will be removing the catalog furniture from the
center of the room and moving much of the Name/Title catalog to the
cabinets on the exterior walls at the south end of the room. Retaining
these catalog cards will ensure that no bibliographic information
important to scholarship will be lost in this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The card catalog has not been updated since 1985, when the libraries
introduced the online catalog, CLIO. As time has passed, the
information in the card catalog has become increasingly inaccurate.
Major historical changes, such as the break-up of the Soviet bloc in
1991 are not reflected. Additionally, the removal of the card catalog
provides the library with an opportunity to continue to improve,
update, and in some cases, add records to CLIO that were not included
in 1985 or in subsequent retrospective conversion projects. These
improvements to CLIO will be noticeable as early as this fall as we
begin to update the holdings information for journals and add missing
microfilm sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The removal of the card catalogs also enables the Libraries to
continue the transformation of Butler Library that began with the
recently completed renovation. Using the historical beauty of the
space as backdrop, Room 310 will be re-purposed to better serve the
emerging research needs of our students and faculty. Over time, Room
310 will be transformed into a Digital Humanities Center (DHC) where
scholars will be able to approach their research in new ways.
Knowledgeable subject specialist librarians and technologists will
help humanities scholars integrate deep research collections across
multiple formats with digital tools and new research methodologies –
all within a space honoring both the rich history of humanities
scholarship at Columbia and the architectural uniqueness of Butler
Library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The removal of the card catalog will bring the Columbia University
Libraries in line with peer institutions that removed their card
catalogs in the last decade; New York University removed their catalog
in 2001, Harvard University in 2003, and Yale University in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;

and shuts the doors) is. Neither of those two unionized parties will
work in environments without reasonable temperature control — the train
would simply be sent for maintenance otherwise — and you can take
advantage of that fact for your own comfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of these two cars, the first is more likely to have seats or liberal

&lt;li&gt;Barring particular designs on a front or rear subway-car door, you
    should aim to enter through a middle door (all cars in the system
    today have either three or four doors). The reason is that it
    generally gives you more options in finding a seat or good standing
    room.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the weather is hot and a car is empty, the chances are good that
    its air conditioning is broken. You can generally tell this
    considerably before the doors open, assuming you're alert to the
    possibility. So if you must have air conditioning, you'll be able to
    maneuver quickly to a neighboring car, even before the doors open.
    But bear in mind that an overcrowded car with air conditioning —
    especially near the doors, where people tend to be more closely
    packed and air conditioning is weaker — may feel just as hot as an
    empty car without; and in the empty car you can sit down and fan
    yourself with your charming Japanese fan.&lt;/li&gt;

my height measured at campus medical offices and I was 5'6". but around
twelve years ago, I was 5'5", as measured in a number of doctors'
offices. That continued up to my August, 2010, physical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my surprise, last November, 2011, my doctor's office found me to be
5'6". And this month I am 5'7". They measured me on two different
machines, just to be sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am past the age when people grow. I have always had good posture, and
am not aware of any changes in how I stand — either at the doctor's or
in general. I have worked standing for most of the time since 1997.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My doctor said, "This doesn't happen, but it happened." His only idea
was that exercise might have subtly altered my posture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two years ago I began exercising fairly seriously — mainly on an
elliptical machine. There are something over 20 free vertebrae, plus the
knee joint. If each joint has stronger musculature and is able to be
held just two mm. further apart when I am standing at attention, that
would round up to two inches' increase in height.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have done nothing special for my diet in this time — I have eaten
mostly fish, fruit, nuts, green stir-fryable vegetables, whole grains,
and cheese for many years, with the occasional bacon double
cheeseburger, cheese pizza, or chocolate bar when feeling stressed. I
have rarely gotten what I felt was enough sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll continue to exercise but I predict I will never make it to 5'8".
Anyway, I am perfectly satisfied being considered short in this society,
and have never craved height.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Alternate ways to say "pop" and "push" in computer science</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/alternate-ways-to-say-pop-and-push-in-computer-science.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-08-23T06:53:00-04:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2012-08-23:alternate-ways-to-say-pop-and-push-in-computer-science.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Donald Knuth's &lt;em&gt;Art of Computer Programming&lt;/em&gt; is dense and, some say, out
of date for fast-evolving subjects like random-number generation. But it

field, here and there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discussion of words used in connection with stacks and queues (Vol.

things, Knuth also mentions that Alan Turing's words for "push" and
"pop" were "bury" and "disinter/unbury" (Vol. I, p. 459, sec. 2.6).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading this, I take the point about "pop" and "push" perpetuating
misleading imagery. I really think we should be saying

Carmélites&lt;/em&gt; at the Dell' Arte Opera Ensemble][], in a 250-seat
performance space on 13th Street and Third Avenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dell' Arte trains young singers who are trying to make the jump
between academic training and stage careers. These days they have
performances only in the second half of August each year. There are two
more shows to go and I recommend this one highly; we're going to try
their &lt;em&gt;Carmen&lt;/em&gt; shortly, too, but &lt;em&gt;Carmélites&lt;/em&gt; is staged less often and
although I can't speak to the &lt;em&gt;Carmen&lt;/em&gt; just yet, knowing what I know
tonight I'd recommend seeing &lt;em&gt;Carmélites&lt;/em&gt;. All five of the principal
female roles were very well cast, and while there were a couple of very
minor mishaps — in the orchestra and English supertitles — the show was
memorably impressive and a steal at \$30 for a regular ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theatre, the East Thirteenth Street Theatre, is busier as the home
of the &lt;a href="http://www.classicstage.org/"&gt;Classic Stage Company (CSC)&lt;/a&gt;. The space is a good one — nicely
laid out and acoustically satisfactory. I was raised in the big concert
and opera houses of this city — and the big museums and parks, too — and
of that sort of thing I have had enough for a lifetime. For my money, it
is much better to experience creative work of all kinds in a venue of
proper, I mean human, proportions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That reminds me of a comment of Elia Kazan (1909–2003) about Lincoln
Center, where he and a friend were involved in the original planning of
the Vivian Beaumont Theatre:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A building of any kind expresses not only the requirements and perhaps
the character of a client but also the architect's feelings about the
culture of his day. … Lincoln Center with its opulence reflects the
tastes and ideals of the kind of upper-middle-class person who goes to
the opening of the opera each fall dressed in the costume head-waiters
wear. The two Chagalls hang like trophies in the opera house, their
details out of all scale with the place. "America can buy the best!"
might be the motto there. "Culture is good business!" is also being
promoted. We hoped there would be a contrast between the
pretentiousness of the outside of our building and what was offered
within. … We wanted a stage that would help impel us to braver work by
its design and its placement in relation to the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Kazan eventually left the project.] … What we'd planned so carefully
and worked on for so long was passed on to others, who couldn't help
being bewildered by what we'd handed down. … The story of our building
is the story of Lincoln Center, an art administrated by real estate
operators and bankers who demand, not effort in a new direction, but
reliable returns on an investment and proof against costs, and who
have neither the patience nor the money to give to people who might be
trying to create a new kind of theatre, nor the time they need to find
their way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exterior of the Vivian Beaumont when I walk past it now reminds me
of the tomb of a Japanese emperor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Elia Kazan, &lt;em&gt;A Life&lt;/em&gt;, [N.p.: Da Capo Press, 1997], pp. 612–14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm glad to say there were no imperial tombs suggested by any part of
tonight's performance.&lt;/p&gt;

Chull Shin&lt;/a&gt;'s new study of democracy in East Asia, (&lt;em&gt;Confucianism and
Democratization in East Asia&lt;/em&gt;). From Nathan's review:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In China, 65 percent of respondents endorsed democracy in principle,
but only 28 percent considered the opportunity to change governments
through elections to be essential to democracy, and fewer than four
percent said that the freedom to criticize people in power is
essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The values of people in Confucian Asia are no more Confucian than
those of people elsewhere; indeed, they are often less so. Smaller
proportions of citizens in the region are devoted to paternalistic
meritocracy than in non-Confucian Asia, which Shin defines as
Indonesia, Malaysia, Mongolia, the Philippines, and Thailand. Compared
with six other regions studied in the World Values Survey, Confucian
Asia is only the fourth-most hierarchical, after the Muslim world,
Africa, and Latin America. A plausible interpretation of such findings
is that so-called Confucian values are not distinctively Asian at all;
instead, they belong to a more universal category of traditional
values. That interpretation gains support from the fact that the
countries of Confucian Asia are far from monolithic in their norms and
beliefs. Fewer than seven percent of Japanese adhere to hierarchical
values, compared with more than 40 percent of Vietnamese; more than
half of South Koreans are egalitarians, compared with only 30 percent
of Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shin uses data from extensive surveys conducted in 2005–08 by the World
Values Survey Association and the Asian Barometer Survey. Nathan argues
in favor of (carefully conducted) surveys as a better tool for studying
the beliefs "of" a society than pronouncements by public intellectuals
and ideologues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey method remains indispensable. No other approach does as
good a job of finding out what large numbers of people actually
believe. And it is less reductive than the older method of gesturing
in the direction of an entire nation and claiming that all its members
share some vaguely defined set of norms.&lt;/p&gt;

articles on Gothic architecture digitized and typeset before the first

recognition (OCR), which saves me having to type it. But the footnotes
are something else, and there are scads of them. They are filled with
book titles in italics, and in a variety of languages. The originals are

eligible to vote, even though none of us had been notified of the

the language of choice for coding a program to report contractual
cash-flow provisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their reasons were two:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python is open source, hence not susceptible to proprietary
    restrictions on users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python is interpreted, hence more transparent than compiled
    executable code, and so less likely to contain malicious
    functionality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key passage in this 667-page document follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are proposing new Rule 314 of Regulation S-T to require that the
waterfall computer program be written in the Python programming
language and be filed as source code that is able to be downloaded and
run on a local computer properly configured with a Python interpreter.
As we note above, Python is an open source interpreted programming
language. Open source means that the source code is available to all
users (as opposed to proprietary source code that can be viewed only
by the owner or developer of the program). An interpreted language is
a programming language that requires an interpreter in the target
computer for program execution. We prohibit the inclusion of
executable code in electronic submissions on EDGAR because of the
computer security risks posed by accepting executable code for filing.
Executable code results from separately compiling a computer program
prior to running it. Since Python is an interpreted language that does
not need to be compiled prior to running it, executable code would not
need to be published on EDGAR, and we would not require EDGAR to
establish facilities to host, run, or operate any computer program.
The waterfall computer program source code would be required to be
submitted as tagged XML data. The EDGAR Technical Specification would
contain detailed information on how to file the waterfall computer
program.&lt;/p&gt;

superb! Memorably inspiring! A relic of Eden!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the food is fair. The cornbread is passable, the desserts
are too sweet and lacking subtlety, the sausages are unnecessarily
greasy, the side dishes are mostly uninteresting. The "greens" are an
embarrassment to anyone who has experienced Chinese food and knows what
green vegetables are supposed to look and taste like. The fact that they
offer you revolting white bread or crackers to eat your meat with is
vulgar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose many of these items are aimed at the "normal" barbecue market
and are part of the authenticity of the place. All right, I understand
the marketing need to do it this way. But the pork chop and lean brisket
are transcendental, and well worth a visit if you actually like good
food. Just pass on the other things. and have your vegetables, starch,
and dessert somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;

recipe I wrote about earlier&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fish-counter man at Fairway 131st St. had never heard of herring and
tried to interest me in bacalao.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I escaped and made my way down to Citarella, where they really know
fish. No, they've had no herring in a long time. But I bought some fresh
mackerel filets and tried them instead. I was surprised that the souring
time is only a day — I'm used to living with the noxious vapors of
souring cabbage for a week or more (I use kimchee ingredients but
regular green cabbage instead of bokchoy, and I prefer habanero peppers,
which do not waste time making food redder than it is hot). For the
record, I used a red onion, fennel, and lots of dill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight it was ready. My wife, who does not believe in the existence of
pickled fish, made a face and said,
"今天家裡一直聞到一股臭味，不知道是什麼，我以為是老鼠尿。" [There was a
bad smell at home all day. I didn't know what it was; I thought it was
mouse urine.] I don't think it smells anything like mouse urine. But she
got well out of the way as I went to work transferring the fish to small
containers for the refrigerator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's pretty good. It's not at all salty — in fact, I think I'll add a
little salt to the remainder I put in the refrigerator. The flesh itself
is superb. The skin is a little tougher than I'm used to with commercial
soured herring, so the eating experience is somewhat new to me. But this
is much, much tastier than commercial soured herring — much milder, and
the fish is really wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Images (figures) on facing pages in a LaTeX document</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/images-figures-on-facing-pages-in-a-latex-document.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-07-26T11:19:00-04:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2012-07-26:images-figures-on-facing-pages-in-a-latex-document.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;For figures on facing pages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edwin Jaynes (1922–98) left some interesting discussions on probability
terminology (2004: 240-42). Jaynes shows that the German origin of the
name means that it was originally intended to be parsed as a "central
theorem", but he adds that the notion of a theorem on a "limit toward a
central distribution … will be invoking just the right intuitive
picture."&lt;/p&gt;

for the Notes collection&lt;/a&gt; and search for "reload".]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ipython.org/"&gt;Ipython&lt;/a&gt; is a useful application that provides an interactive shell
for working with the Python programming language. I find it far better
than Idle for all the IDE-like support I need while working with this
language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you modify your code while running Ipython, there are two ways to
make the shell aware of it without restarting the shell:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have imported your code as a module, the python command
    &lt;code&gt;reload()&lt;/code&gt; will reimport the current version of it. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ln&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;my_code&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="cp"&gt;# my_code.py is now being updated elsewhere&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;ln&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;reload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;my_code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The updated version of &lt;code&gt;my_code.py&lt;/code&gt; is now available within the
shell, and the shell will confirm that by returning the name of the
module, in angle brackets; for instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;my_code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;my_code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pyc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I usually assign a variable name to imported modules so I don't have
to type them out at length:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ln&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;my_code&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="cp"&gt;# my_code.py is now being updated elsewhere&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;ln&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;reload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;my_code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;my_code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pyc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The result is the same as above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ipython (v. 0.12) has a module &lt;code&gt;autoreload&lt;/code&gt; that reloads not only
    the module you are running as &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt;, but also any other modules
    called by the main program. &lt;code&gt;autoreload&lt;/code&gt; must be explicitly
    imported, using &lt;code&gt;import autoreload&lt;/code&gt; in Ipython or the configuration
    files. After that, entering the magic command &lt;code&gt;%autoreload&lt;/code&gt;
    automatically reloads all relevant modules, including those called
    by others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;%autoreload&lt;/code&gt; currently has a few extensions and commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;%aimport my_module&lt;/code&gt;: import &lt;code&gt;my_module&lt;/code&gt; alone and mark it for
    regular reloading with &lt;code&gt;%autoreload 1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;%aimport -my_module&lt;/code&gt;: mark &lt;code&gt;my_module&lt;/code&gt; as not to be
    automatically reloaded&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;%aimport&lt;/code&gt;: without the name of a module, lists those modules
    marked for regular reloading with &lt;code&gt;%autoreload 1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;%autoreload 0&lt;/code&gt;: disable automatic reloading of modules&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;%autoreload 1&lt;/code&gt;: from now on, always reload those modules marked
    with &lt;code&gt;%aimport&lt;/code&gt; before executing any Python code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;%autoreload 2&lt;/code&gt;: from now on, always reload all modules (except
    those marked with &lt;code&gt;%aimport&lt;/code&gt; to be ignored) before executing any
    Python code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;%autoreload&lt;/code&gt;: single reload of all modules (except those marked
    with &lt;code&gt;%aimport&lt;/code&gt; to be ignored)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This accomplishes the same result as &lt;code&gt;reload()&lt;/code&gt; and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

replacements soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a time when linden flowers and fennel were among the varieties
of herb tea I could get around my New York neighborhood, in ordinary
packaging in a number of supermarkets. Now everything seems to be
proprietary-sounding health-mixtures: "Mother-To-Be", "Joint Comfort",
"Om", "Skin DeTox", and so on. Peppermint and chamomile are almost the
only two you can easily buy that don't have cloyingly fruity ingredients
or real tea in them. Hibiscus is available here and there. I have a
feeling there is also now a lot more Chinese and Japanese tea in
supermarkets than there used to be — though of far lower quality than
what I am used to, through my special sources. Frankly, I was happier
with a bigger choice of raw ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, though, I found linden flowers ("lime blossom", "tilleul",
etc.), lemon verbena, lavender, and fennel — all for sale at Fairway in
their own cheap plastic packaging. An alternative is probably Kalustyan
on Lexington in the 20s, where a vast choice of herbs, but overpriced,
is to be found. However, Fairway on 131st St. is nearer and cheaper. I
will continue to try to buy plain herbs and steep them singly or in my
own unnamed mixtures as long as I can. There is, of course, always
Chinatown for a wide selection of certain things — licorice root, for
instance.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Elia Kazan on the need for selfishness</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/elia-kazan-on-the-need-for-selfishness.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-07-01T18:03:00-04:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2012-07-01:elia-kazan-on-the-need-for-selfishness.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the recurring ideas in Elia Kazan's memoirs is that success
requires passion and passion requires selfishness. Below are a few
extracts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I hear the phrase "master class," I want to vomit. Today when I'm
consulted by an eager newcomer about whom to "go to for help," I
generally answer that I can't offer advice unless and until I know
more about him — which I make damned sure I don't have time to do. …
Yes, the experience of other actors and directors can be communicated
and does help, but on the whole it's better for a young actor, driven
by a strong desire, to stumble, fall, pick up, come on again, to find
his way. (p. 142)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remembered an old saying, "Anyone who cannot feel &lt;em&gt;passionate&lt;/em&gt; love
for women, flowers, or wine or for the work he is doing, anyone who is
not in some way &lt;em&gt;un&lt;/em&gt;reasonable and &lt;em&gt;un&lt;/em&gt;balanced, will never, never
have any talent for literature. (p. 215)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe every artist is, as he has to be, arrogant. You may not go
along with that; the word has unfortunate connotations. But whatever
else an artist may be saying in his work, he is certainly saying "I'm
important!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arrogance, when it's depicted on the screen or stage, is usually
projected by boisterous behavior. Not so in life. The most arrogant
people I've known — people whom I admire for this quality as well as
for the work they do — are often quiet with the special ease that
comes from being sure of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artists are different from other people, and they do behave
differently. I've already expressed my opinion that vanity — one of
the seven deadly sins — is often a spur to creation in a filmmaker.
Now consider the seven deadly virtues for the artist. Here are seven:
Agreeable. Accommodating. Fair-minded. Well balanced. Obliging.
Generous. Democratic. You don't agree with my choices? How about
these: Controlled. Kind. Unprejudiced. Yielding. Unassertive.
Faithful. Self-effacing. And for good measure: Cooperative. They are
all deadly — for the artist. They add up to what is suggested by "nice
guy," "sweet," "pleasant," "lovable," "on the side of the angels."
None of which any artist is, should be, or ever has been. If he seems
that way, he is concealing his true nature. He should better be a
disrupter, on the side of the devil. (p. 299)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Three qualities] necessary for a man working in the arts: vain,
arrogant, and unyielding. (p. 301)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great theatre works I'd heard tell about and read about were
finally the product of a single artist, an individual who was his own
man, a visionary with a special vision and a dominating ego. It has
always been thus and always would be. I knew that very well know. I
knew that dependence on, or collaboration with, even a man I respected
as much as I did [Director] Harold [Clurman] was not good. (p. 322)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Quoting John Steinbeck:]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get mean. Get selfish. Be yourself. Find out who you are — it's the
only creative source you have. Determine what you want and don't stand
still for anything else. Find out what your place in the world is and
claim it for your own and don't let anyone take it away. (p. 594)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Composer Manos Hadjidakis] had the most overwhelming joy in working
and in his work; it was easy for him, and once he started, he was like
all the other geniuses I've known, a compulsive hard worker. He'd
earned his success the hard way. The old saying that genius is ten
percent inspiration and ninety percent perspiration underestimates the
importance of relentless effort. But work doesn't describe what these
men do. There is a blacking out of everything else in their lives;
it's all secondary — love, greed, pleasure, family. The work
experience is what they want from life. They don't know how to
"unwind," nor do they want to. (p. 658)&lt;/p&gt;

up by his thumbs, slit his belly open and pour gasoline inside, then
ignite it. Our men had their answer; they took forty-nine Japanese
prisoners, tied them up in a tight ring, doused them with airplane
fuel, and burned them all. Gasoline was in plentiful supply. When they
flew Japanese prisoners back for questioning on a C-47, they kept the
freight door at the side of the plane open, and when the questioning
of each man was concluded, he'd be kicked overboard before they
reached their destination. Neither side took prisoners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The most striking change has been an increasing number of presidents
coming from backgrounds that are not academic. They're coming from
law, from business, and they don't have an understanding of a
commitment to the academic enterprise," said Robert Kreiser, senior

&lt;p&gt;Comment: This trend has been developing ever since the 1960s, but it
really began to take off in the early- to mid-1990s. Faculty I speak to
today are generally well aware of the extent and history of
bureaucratization, because there is still good institutional,
disciplinary, and professional memory among academics. Among students,
however, and more dismayingly among lower-tier academic bureaucrats
themselves, there is very little awareness of the fact that universities
today are not much like what they were thirty years ago, to say nothing
of fifty years ago. They didn't used to be nearly so corporate.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Bogusław Jackowski on "worldwide licensing madness" (2008)</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/boguslaw-jackowski-on-worldwide-licensing-madness-2008.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-06-26T14:39:00-04:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2012-06-26:boguslaw-jackowski-on-worldwide-licensing-madness-2008.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Bogusław Jackowski:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another frustrating, if not annoying, aspect is a worldwide licensing
madness. We have to spent our time struggling with license problems,
an area in which we are completely ignorant, because licenses became
an obligatory part of software packages. At the same time, we are
aware that the GPL, being recently in fashion, is hardly suitable for
such font projects like TEX Gyre. Moreover, we have to answer arrogant
letters from commercial firms because we happened to use in an
unfortunate context a registered font name, etc. How can intelligent
people seriously consider such things? The incredible heritage of
mankind awaits for every newborn man, in particular, speech, art,
technology, and science. Such a man grows making use of all mankind’s
achievements, but then invents serendipitously a new dot or a comma
and demands a long-lasting protection of "creator's" rights … .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nice story was told by Hermann Zapf during the European TEX Users
Meeting in Pont-à-Mousson, 2005. One of the first persons who brought
a lawsuit (incidentally, in the USA) for an unauthorised usage of his
typeface design, was Frederic W. Goudy. After Goudy’s long
explanations of what is the font design, the trial was practically
concluded by the judge’s question: "Mr. Goudy, are you the inventor of
the alphabet?"&lt;/p&gt;

only by officials but also by individual people. What do you do if you
are a foreigner and your documents aren't affixed with these things?
Certain people are likely to doubt the validity of your documents! What
do you do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You get them affixed anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I went to do my fieldwork in China, I was required to bring a chest
x-ray of myself, but it had to be an official one. To make it official,
I had the x-ray embossed repeatedly with an embosser from the hospital,
and also affixed with paper stickers on which several address-stamps
were stamped in blue or black, and over which various hospital employees
- whoever happened to be around - signed their names. (No red ink for
the signatures, of course, as it is considered a bad thing in China —
funny, considering that "red ink" is an English metonymy for
bureaucratic fuss.) That seemed to do the trick. As someone later said,
it still wasn't an official Chinese x-ray, but it looked far more
serious than what the other foreigners in Fúzhōu that year had brought.
Some of them, as I recall, were required to have new x-rays taken there;
I was not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also brought a copy of our marriage license, which in New York at that
time was just a flimsy scrap of photocopy paper, hard to read and
yellowing. It had come embossed with a seal and stamped with a
multicolored stamp that contained a facsimile of the County Clerk of New
York County at the time we were married. But I was warned that it would
not be recognized by the Chinese government. So I had it re-certified by
the County Clerk's office, adding another layer of paper bearing the
actual signature of the current County Clerk, and that allowed me to get
a certificate from the office of the Secretary of State of New York
State attesting to the authenticity of that signature. The latter
certificate was sufficient to be recognized by the Consulate of the
People's Republic of China, which affixed its own certificate, attesting
to the authenticity of the signature of the Deputy Secretary of State of
New York State. The Chinese certificate was signed by a consular
official and stamped with a red seal. The whole pile of papers was
stamped with an embosser. None of the three certifying documents said
anything about the original being a marriage certificate – they merely
testified to the authenticity of the signature of the official on the
previous document. I carried this little set of papers with me during
all our travels to China, over many years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We only had to use the marriage certificate once or twice — once when
introducing ourselves to the local officials who sponsored me after my
academic sponsor abandoned me, and once when checking into an official
guesthouse in another city and asked to prove that we were married. My
wife, however, being a Taiwanese compatriot (albeit traveling on a US
passport), was not required to have an x-ray at all, even though she
came to all the same places I did and stayed for the same length of
time.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Bond Street and a story about a smartphone</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/bond-street-and-a-story-about-a-smartphone.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-06-17T19:06:00-04:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2012-06-17:bond-street-and-a-story-about-a-smartphone.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Two years ago I got a wonderful HTC Android smartphone, but last year I
decided to cancel the subscription and went back to my old cellphone. My
old phone has better sound and is much easier to answer, hang up, and
dial than the HTC phone or indeed any other smartphone I've tried. I
rarely play mobile games, and I'm never without something to read on the
subway — I almost always have a programming manual or piece of
non-fiction in my pack, and for that matter I still get the Wall Street
Journal in paper (it comes free with an academic on-line subscription).
I was glad to save \$60 a month in connectivity fees, and I haven't
minded using the Android only offline or occasionally with WiFi. My
Verizon Wireless cellphone plan is \$30 a month for 100 minutes and 250
text messages, and these days I never exceed the quota.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I was headed to a breakfast meeting on Bond Street.
Google Maps, to which I turned the night before, gave me its always
reliable and accurate map and travel times, and I arrived at the Hoyt
Street Station in Brooklyn and walked to the address on Bond St. in
about two minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one was there. There was also no café there. I then remembered that
there was a Bond St. in New York, too, but couldn't recall exactly
where. The woman in the subway booth had never heard of it. Time was
short. I knew this Bond St. was in lower Manhattan somewhere, but
getting from Brooklyn to near an imprecisely known New York neighborhood
by subway involves a certain amount of intelligent gambling. I took the
train back to 14th St. and 7th Avenue, but various people working at
that station hadn't heard of Bond St., New York, either. They also had
no suggestion as to how I might find it. In the old days, the people in
the subway booths and the track workers seemed to know every street in
the city, but apparently those days are gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passing strangers also knew only of the Brooklyn Bond St. I went out of
the station for a cell phone signal and called the MTA's help line,
which is entirely automated now. It put me on hold after failing to
understand my instructions. After ten minutes, it directed me to look on
the internet, which of course I couldn't do, and then hung up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, a young man with a smartphone took 30 seconds out of his day
and found Bond Street for me. Of course! It's one block below Great
Jones Street on either side of Lafayette! I cross it on nearly every
walk I take to Chinatown, and am always in a good mood when I do because
the name Great Jones Street always makes me happy. I hustled there on
foot — the man with the smartphone was amazed that I didn't want to go
by subway, but that would have been much more complicated. I made it to
the breakfast gathering an hour late, but still in time to meet a most
interesting person. I had the sense that my persistence in getting to my
destination was an omen of gaining a worthwhile acquaintanceship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's clear that without some sort of connectivity, I cannot make up for
the erosion of public intellectual infrastructure that is now normal in
the city. Many people just don't hold the same amount of information in
the brains that they — that all of us — used to. Of course, subway
workers still can't necessarily use their smartphones underground, and
as a result they have much less information than even ordinary
passengers do when we stand near the exits. These days I don't travel
all that much to unfamiliar places, and having a smartphone or connected
tablet is still not as urgent for me as it was a few years ago, but I
have the sensation that that will change soon.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Another bond to Apple is lost as MobileMe Sync is discontinued</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/another-bond-to-apple-is-lost-as-mobileme-sync-is-discontinued.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-06-17T17:33:00-04:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2012-06-17:another-bond-to-apple-is-lost-as-mobileme-sync-is-discontinued.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since Apple will stop supporting MobileMe Sync at the end of this month,
at least for some of the operating systems still in contented use in our

recordings for me, something I regard as an offensive intrusion into my
research life, since I still use iTunes for thousands of original
recordings connected to my fieldwork and my study of accented Mandarin.
One more bond to Apple, which I began using in 1985 and at one time
adored, is about to break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the datebook, it is not difficult to make use of Google's calendar,
whose API now conveniently supports many laptop and mobile applications
— an earlier updating conflict with Apple's iCal was resolved a year or
more ago. I have now settled on Mozilla's Thunderbird — not for the mail
service but for the calendar alone — and found it easy to make the
transition from iCal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also going to have to find a replacement for Apple's address book,
but in this case I don't want to use Google, since Google immediately
does things with Apple address book information — among other things, it
deletes all the notes, and combines the incoming entries with what is
already in my gmail account, and tries to "help" me in ways that just
cost me time to undo manually. It may be that I have to pay for a
separate service like Zimbra, though a more interesting prospect is to
set up my own contacts database on my own server and access the
information that way.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Charles Ives (1874–1954) on his life in business (1933)</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/charles-ives-1874-1954-on-his-life-in-business-1933.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-06-15T23:16:00-04:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2012-06-15:charles-ives-1874-1954-on-his-life-in-business-1933.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The composer Charles Ives (1874–1954) worked professionally not as a

&lt;p&gt;My business experience revealed life to me in many aspects that I
might otherwise have missed. In it one sees tragedy, nobility,
meanness, high aims, low aims, brave hopes, faint hopes, great ideals,
no ideals, and one is able to watch these work inevitable destiny. And
it has seemed to me that the finer sides of these traits were not only
in the majority but in the ascendancy. I have seen men fight honorably
and to a finish, solely for a matter of conviction or of principle —
and where expediency, probable loss of business, prestige or position
had no part and threats no effect. It is my impression that there is
more open-mindedness and willingness to examine carefully the premises
underlying a new or unfamiliar thing, before condemning it, in the
world of business than in the world of music. It is not even uncommon
in business intercourse to sense a reflection of a philosophy — a
depth of something fine — akin to a strong beauty in art. To assume
that business is a material process, and only that, is to undervalue
the average mind and heart. To an insurance man there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; an 'average
man' and he is humanity. I have experienced a great fullness of life
in business. The fabric of existence weaves itself whole. You can not
set an art off in the corner and hope for it to have vitality, reality
and substance. There can be nothing &lt;em&gt;'exclusive'&lt;/em&gt; about a substantial
art. It comes directly out of the heart of experience of life and
thinking about life and living life. My work in music helped my
business and my work in business helped my music.&lt;/p&gt;

battlegrounds between the Soviets and the US. One very simple token of
that rivalry was the competing terms "cosmonaut" and "astronaut", which
of course mean same thing but signal different linguistic identities and
so political affiliations. The introduction of a Chinese-based term for
the same idea told me that China was dissatisfied with the outcome of
the last round of this battle, in which she played a distant second
fiddle to the USSR. The USSR lost the First Cold War, and so did China,
by association. Well, China wants a rematch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although "Cold War thinking" (&lt;em&gt;lěngzhàn sīxiǎng&lt;/em&gt; 冷戰思想) has become a
common Chinese smear against Americans and their allies, things have now
developed to the point that any reasonably neutral observer can see
where they are going. It will be interesting to watch how Americans
awaken to this issue and how they react to it. I, for one, will try to
keep my eyes open.&lt;/p&gt;

students up by asking them to undertake short experiments that are

lab, and finding the expected result planned for them by the teacher,
students learn what every experienced researcher in the world knows:
that experiments, like scholarly research of any kind, almost never
proceed exactly as you planned them, and that you can learn a lot from
your failures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Mr. Bradbury championed the space program as an adventure that
humanity dared not shirk, he was content to restrict his own
adventures to the realm of imagination. He lived in the same house in
Los Angeles for more than 5o years …. For many years he refused to
travel by plane, preferring trains, and he never learned to drive. [—

time, but I recommend it for breakfast, too. Below I describe the what
but not the where. The main types of offerings are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dim sum, now a familiar event in the culinary repertoire of New
    Yorkers. Ideally, it is a brunch or afternoon tea snack served along
    with a pot of good plain or flower-infused black tea. The "sum" is
    correctly pronounced somewhat like the English word &lt;em&gt;sum&lt;/em&gt;; don't
    change the vowel to the English short &lt;em&gt;oo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Congee and/or dumplings and/or another starch. In traditional
    Chinatown one generally gets the Cantonese and Chaozhou forms of
    these things. On East Broadway ("Fúzhōu Street"), Division St., and
    Eldridge St. these days there is also the Fúzhōu version of the
    same, which is quite distinctive. &lt;em&gt;Congee&lt;/em&gt; is a word of Malay
    origin, from the same generation of East Asian vocabulary — which
    entered English in the time of Captain Cook — that supplied us with
    &lt;em&gt;catty&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;bamboo&lt;/em&gt;, among others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The bun and pastry experience, also associated with tea or coffee
    but less distinctive than dim sum and the venues generally less
    genteel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dim sum is too well documented to need discussion here. It is suited to
groups of three to ten people, although there's nothing quite like a
nice table for two. I like to think that dim sum is more a tool to
stimulate conversation than a kind of food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buns and pastry are easily figured out — the most unusual may be the
fried sesame ball or &lt;em&gt;jiānduī&lt;/em&gt; 煎堆, a ball of glutinous rice dough,
filled with red bean paste or the less-sweet yellow lotus-seed paste,
deep fried and coated in sesame seeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The middle group — congee, dumplings, and starches — are immensely
diverse and grade into the normal range of Chinese cooking — meat and
vegetables, and so on. Since I typically walk to Chinatown for breakfast
and am more thirsty than hungry when I arrive, I tend to have soup with
dumplings in it. There's a lot to say about the soup-offerings, but in a
few words here are the most distinctive choices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shrimp/pork dumpling soup (many venues; these are various called
    &lt;em&gt;yúntūn&lt;/em&gt; 雲吞 or &lt;em&gt;húndùn&lt;/em&gt; 餛飩 "wontons" or &lt;em&gt;shuǐjiǎo&lt;/em&gt; 水餃);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;white pepper-seasoned dumpling with fish-based rather than
    flour-based skin (Cháozhōu, one venue at breakfast-time, "&lt;em&gt;yúpíjiǎo&lt;/em&gt;
    魚皮角);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;celery-tinctured pork or mutton maw soup (Fúzhōu, one venue I know
    of, &lt;em&gt;zhū/yángdǔguàn&lt;/em&gt; 豬/羊肚罐子 — you will probably hear 肚
    rendered &lt;em&gt;dù&lt;/em&gt;);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;glutinous-rice dumpling balls filled with highly seasoned pork
    (Fúzhōu, much the same place to place because not made in-house,
    &lt;em&gt;yuánxiāo&lt;/em&gt; 元宵)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dumpling with pork-based rather than flour-based skin (Fúzhōu, much
    the same place to place because not made in-house, &lt;em&gt;yànwán&lt;/em&gt; 燕丸);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cornstarch based floppy noodle-like thing (Fúzhōu, "&lt;em&gt;yànmiàn&lt;/em&gt;
    燕麵");&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pork dumplings with shepherd's purse (&lt;em&gt;jìcài&lt;/em&gt; 薺菜, though you may
    hear 薺 as &lt;em&gt;qí&lt;/em&gt;) or the strong-tasting Chinese "leek" (&lt;em&gt;jiǔcài&lt;/em&gt;
    韭菜); these are northern, and there are several venues right now,
    all very low-end — your soup is served in a plastic take-out
    container, rather than a bowl.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good soup of course depends primarily on good stock, and part of my
pleasure in exploring the breakfast offerings is sampling what different
chefs can do with bones and water each morning before the restaurants
open.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Zed Shaw on why to use C (2011)</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/zed-shaw-on-why-to-use-c-2011.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-06-03T20:55:00-04:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2012-06-03:zed-shaw-on-why-to-use-c-2011.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Zed Shaw:&lt;/p&gt;

countryside. In China, anything like this hinges on personal
connections; paper credentials alone mean little. My chief supporter was
the father of a fellow student of mine — I had given my classmate
extensive help with her dissertation, and my professor had also done the
father many quiet courtesies. By the Chinese calculus of favor-debt,
this powerful person was obligated to my teacher and indirectly to me,
and he agreed to sponsor me and get me to the countryside, where I could
work under the radar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I reached China, however, my sponsor took me to the Party Secretary
in a small city and offered my services as an unsalaried English teacher
in a vocational school there, to pay off some other favor-debt of his
own. That would have ended my research and wasted two years of
preparation and a Federal grant. Within the Chinese moral system, as a
student I had no right to stand up to him, since our whole agreement was
informal — especially since he was proposing to bend rules for me just
as rules had earlier been bent for his daughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once he left, I politely declined the teaching "job" and visited the
local government. I explained my situation, showed my letters of
authorization from Central Government ministries, and negotiated
official sponsorship by the local government. I relied on that
sponsorship to complete some three years of original research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had no preparation for the negotiation and did it under considerable
stress. But I learned more about China in those few days than in my
whole previous education.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Age and the MBA</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/age-and-the-mba.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-05-29T20:02:00-04:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2012-05-29:age-and-the-mba.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A correspondent challenged me to produce any reputable-looking on-line

&lt;p&gt;Age discrimination laws mean banks will never admit to turning
their noses up at fresh MBAs aged 33+, but this is the reality.
Hiring a recent MBA aged 40+ is totally unheard of. "As a general
rule, banks hire MBAs into their associate programmes when they
are in their high 20s and low 30s," says Julian Birkinshaw, deputy
dean at the London Business School.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
"There isn't an age at which it's too old to do an MBA, but there
is a point at which big name recruiters will stop being very
interested in you," Birkinshaw adds. "They will never say this,
but the reality is that organizations like banks are looking for
people who will give them the best years of their lives and who
have the potential to become managing directors before the age of
40."&lt;/p&gt;

differently, particularly when it comes to dot coms with a young

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The equation changes when you are over 50. Unfortunately, it is
very difficult to get a corporate job at that age. Companies like
hiring younger people, who they feel can often do the same work at
a lower price. Yes, I know, the older person has more wisdom and
experience, but ask yourself, when was the last time you hired
someone over 50?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
With rare (although not impossible) opportunities in the corporate
world, the experienced person is forced to look elsewhere, and
will quickly discover that he can be much happier, fulfilled, and
even bankable by working for himself. This is the time to consult,
advise, mentor, and teach. This is also the time to try to start
that new company idea that you have always had in the back of your
mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is actually a great deal of this kind on line. Rather than
wallowing in the maudlin, consider this advice (excerpted) about how to
approach the issue productively from Deborah Knox of Insight Admissions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First and foremost, make sure you're very competitive. …&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you're looking to switch careers, do your research and find out
    if making the move to your new career of choice is likely. …&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prepare the best application possible, …&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider applying to at least a few schools that have a higher
    average age, assuming you'd be happy to attend their program. …&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't completely reject the part-time and EMBA options, especially
    if you need the skills more than the brand and the network. …&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Thu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mo"&gt;01&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Dec&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1994&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mo"&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mo"&gt;00&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;Thu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;26&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Jan&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mo"&gt;01&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;Tue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Jan&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2010&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;48&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mo"&gt;00&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Note that this is different from what is output by Python's
&lt;code&gt;time.asctime()&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The struct_time object&lt;/strong&gt;. Python represents time conveniently as
    a &lt;code&gt;struct_time&lt;/code&gt; object, defined at
    [http://docs.python.org/library/time.html#time.struct_time][] as
    "an object with a named tuple interface: values can be accessed by
    index and by attribute name" (accessed 20120523). Here is what the
    first of the three date-time strings above looks like composed as a
    &lt;code&gt;struct_time&lt;/code&gt; object:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;struct_time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tm_year&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1994&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tm_mon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tm_mday&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tm_hour&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="n"&gt;tm_min&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tm_sec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tm_wday&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tm_yday&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;335&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tm_isdst&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ISO 8601 standard format&lt;/strong&gt;. The International Organization for
    Standardization (ISO) prescribes a standard format for date and
    time: &lt;code&gt;YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss&lt;/code&gt;. See [the ISO's informal description of
    the standard][]. (The 2004 revision of the actual specification,
    which costs money to download, is currently available at [this
    site][].)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compact sortable format&lt;/strong&gt;. For appending to the names of output
    files when I need to generate multiple versions, and for use as a
    sortable but human-readable date-time string, I use a format
    &lt;code&gt;YYYMMDD_hhmmss&lt;/code&gt;. The three dates initially listed above are shown
    in this format here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;19941201&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_160000&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="mi"&gt;20060126&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_150116&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="mi"&gt;20100112&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_134800&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I haven't seen this given a standard name in the Python docs, so I
call it "compact sortable" format; it is more compact than the ISO
8601 standard format but still easy to read. In cases where it is
impossible for there to be more than one output file generated in
the same clock minute, I omit the two digits representing seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Time-format conversions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can use &lt;code&gt;time.strptime&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;time.strftime&lt;/code&gt; to convert to and
    from a &lt;code&gt;struct_time&lt;/code&gt; object using a kind of formatting syntax using
    %, reminiscent of the more primitive of the string-formatting
    syntaxes, and similar to that used in C's &lt;code&gt;sprintf()&lt;/code&gt; function.
    Details are provided in the [Python docs cited
    above][http://docs.python.org/library/time.html#time.struct_time].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HTTP header format&lt;/strong&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;struct_time&lt;/code&gt; object&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;generate HTTP header format from a &lt;code&gt;struct_time&lt;/code&gt; object:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;strftime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;time_struct&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;generate a &lt;code&gt;struct_time&lt;/code&gt; object from HTML header time
    format:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;strptime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;http_header_time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as an identity, deconstruct and regenerate the original HTML
    header time format:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;strftime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="n"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;strptime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;http_header_time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ISO 8601 format&lt;/strong&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;struct_time&lt;/code&gt; object&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;generate ISO 8601 format from a &lt;code&gt;struct_time&lt;/code&gt; object:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;strftime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;time_struct&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;generate a &lt;code&gt;struct_time&lt;/code&gt; object from ISO 8601 format:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;strptime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;iso8601&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as an identity, deconstruct and regenerate the original ISO
    8601 string:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;strftime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;strptime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;iso8601&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;produce &lt;strong&gt;compact sortable format&lt;/strong&gt; from HTML header time format&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;strftime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;%Y%m%d_%H%M%S&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;strptime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;http_header_time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following brief functions can be used&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;make_struct_time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;http_header_time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;header&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;output&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;struct_time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;strptime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;http_header_time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

"&lt;a href=""&gt;Doubleclick Ad Exchange: Connecting the World of Online
Advertising&lt;/a&gt;". It was the most interesting of the several I have been
to (the sole exception is &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/google-nyc-tech-talks/events/16885501/"&gt;one highly technical presentation by Victor
Miller a year ago&lt;/a&gt; on hashing functions). There was a reasonable
amount of detail on some of Google's strategies for ultra low-latency
auctioning of internet advertising, and I was able to enjoy the special
pleasure that you get from listening to smart people explaining
something they know a lot about. If I was not completely won over by
three references to the market's "invisible hand" in various names, that
is the result of my own failure to believe, and Google is not to blame
for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sideshow to the talk was a closer look than usual at some of Google's
security rules. Nothing extraordinary, and I don't think I'm putting the
company at risk in what follows, but the cumulative effect left me in a
state of mellow reflection (possibly not my normal state).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the large presentation theater, we were told we could take
photographs of things within the theater itself but not of anything in
the rest of the space, all of which was completely visible from the
open-walled theater. Okay, I understand the "I shall avert my eyes" rule
and am even able to observe it. But with something over two hundred
strangers in the room, I wonder to what extent the company expects such
a rule to be honored. Making a rule without enforcing it can weaken
one's authority if someone decides to test it, and that is a risk when
the rule isn't easy to enforce, surely a temptation to some of the
contrary among us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More interesting was the security downstairs. There were a number of
people on line at the desk, waiting as a security officer tried to find
someone on the phone to authorize a certain person to enter the
building. We all had our IDs ready to show him. But a moment came when
the officer let through someone who said he was going to be late to the
Tech Talk, and then suddenly all of us who said we were going to the
same place were waved through — without anyone looking at IDs, printed
Meetup "tickets", official name lists, or anything else. I was glad to
get in without further delay, but I think the security officer must have
felt the kind of pressure to which a weak functionary is most
susceptible — fear that he might get in trouble for holding up something
important. I hope the company asks itself what it says to the outside
world when a security officer feels weak and is vulnerable to silly time
pressure of this kind. For security to be respected, doesn't it have to
appear confident, patient, and utterly unruffled?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside security, I faced the familiar little desk with name badges on
it, printed from Meetup's name list. Google is now using a higher
quality name badge than it used to. That gave a more professional
feeling to the visit than used to be the case, certainly. What made me
smile to myself is that, in the lobby of what must be the most
technically innovative company now active in the US, these badges were
still being sorted by hand, as they have been ever since I started
attending the Tech Talks. And this time, the people who were passing
them out actually gave me someone else's badge, without looking at any
of my credentials or even trying to pronounce the last name on the badge
to me (I spelled mine out for them clearly). I didn't realize I had
gotten the wrong badge until I got home later in the evening and took it
off. Only the first letter is the same as in mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess I should be glad whoever got my badge didn't get me in trouble —
he could have photographed the opulent buffet (in the off-camera section
of the meeting space), or stayed behind past the no-peeing hour in the
men's room, or sneaked out of the building through an unauthorized exit
stairway (these were accessible but we were warned away from them in
tremulous gentleness by a junior employee).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose it's something to be grateful for when security, so
frightening in our society in the past decade, is handled softly —
rather than with the ill-concealed hostility that has become common
elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the whole, though I've been irked with some of Google's practices in
the past weeks, I came away with a better overall impression of the
company than I had when I went in, and that surprises me a little, and
pleases me, too.&lt;/p&gt;

whether a webpage had been updated or not, without keeping track of it
myself. Someone suggested the "last-modified" header that supplies a
time and date of last modification; there is also an "etag" header that
supplies a hash of the page content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you examine HTML headers? I wrote a little piece of code to
report them: on line at &lt;a href="https://bitbucket.org/dpb/report_headers"&gt;https://bitbucket.org/dpb/report_headers&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: There are no headers that are always reliable for keeping
track of updated webpages. Some sites provide both "last-modified" and
"etags"; some provide only one of the two. Some provide none — even
major US sites like the Wall Street Journal (wsj.com) don't send
"last-modified". As a matter of fact, WSJ doesn't even report
"content-length". So all bets are off with headers. One can use them
with sites where they are known to be supplied, but other tools are
still needed for sites where they are not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when headers are indeed supplied, there's also the question of
whether they are accurate.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>William Hung 洪業 (1893–1980) on Confucianism (1980)</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/william-hung-1893-1980-on-confucianism-1980.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-05-20T12:33:00-04:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2012-05-20:william-hung-1893-1980-on-confucianism-1980.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Speaking in 1980, the 86-year old William Hung 洪業 (1893–1980) gave

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;以前中國的考試制度目的是為政府培育順從聽話的官吏，雖然孟子說“天視自我民視、天聽自我民聽”這些好聽的話，但一般來說中國的政府不是為人民的，所以皇帝政權一定得推翻，要建立一個民主的政府。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of the Chinese examination system of the past was for the
government to breed compliant, obedient officials. Even though Mencius
said "through our people, Heaven sees; through our people, Heaven
hears" and other such fine-sounding things, China's governments did
not normally act for the people, and so it was inevitable that
Imperial power would be overthrown and a democratic government
established.&lt;/p&gt;

expression, the example of the singer David Daniels holds penetrating
promise:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upset that he couldn't control the higher tenor-range tones — "I
couldn't sing in the top part of my voice," he says, "everything would
flip and crack, flip up into the falsetto" — he sought the help of a
therapist who'd worked with singers with stage anxieties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I told her about my other voice," said the affable Daniels, 31,
chatting at the Opera House recently, "how it felt so natural, how I
could do anything I wanted to do with it: sing high and low, soft and
loud, and never worry about making an ugly, horrible sound. She didn't
understand what I meant by 'other voice,' as if it were separate from
me, (when) it's not, it's part of me, who I am."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniels decided to "make the switch" to countertenor after consulting
with his teacher, George Shirley, who wasn't entirely surprised:
Earlier, Daniels had brought him a tape of himself singing a Verdi
aria but told him it was a female friend. Shirley loved the sound and
after a few minutes realized who it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Everything about me changed," says Daniels, who grew up in a musical
family in South Carolina and sang professionally as a boy soprano. "I
had a complete air of confidence and security." Switching to
countertenor, he says, freed him to do "everything I felt
dramatically, musically, technically and emotionally that I couldn't
get out as a tenor. I can let myself concentrate on things that are
really important — portraying a character and communicating emotion to
an audience."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Overall, I
like his brashness. But he insists a little too often that he is telling
the frank truth, whatever the cost, and that leaves me with a strong
impression of defensiveness. How often should someone who is telling the
truth sound defensive, after establishing at some point that the truth
is what he is going to tell? Kazan also tries to prevent the reader from
judging him by asserting that moral standards are mostly hollow and that
no one is any more honest than he (Kazan) is. That is a weak tactic,
familiar to me from conversations with bullies and manipulators over
many years: it can be effective against an individual, but not against
all readers in the abstract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I grew up hearing that Kazan was a bad man who had betrayed his former
friends to HUAC. Much more recently, I saw documentary interviews with
Kazan and Budd Schulberg, both of whom said that since the Communists
and the McCarthyists were equally gangsters, how could there be any
question of taking sides with either one? That strikes me as basically
correct, whatever qualifications may be necessary. It's true that there
was a conspiracy to numb U.S. public opinion to the brutality of the
Soviet Union, and it's also true that Joseph McCarthy and the company
surrounding him were self-promoting bullies. Both camps were indeed
gangsters and unworthy of the allegiance of decent people. And beyond
that, it's true that for you or me to give expression to our
originality, we have to find ways to get free of the pressure that
bullies and manipulators can impose on us. That seems to be the core of
what Kazan and Schulberg were talking about, and it's a good point in
any era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I got interested in reading what Kazan has to say for himself more
broadly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was dismayed to find that self-righteous betrayal is indeed a big part
of his story — he was monumentally unfaithful to his wife and you can
see over and over again that he is ashamed of it, exactly because of his
many attempts to excuse it or neutralize the reader's disapproval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
And then, after all, there is this, which dates from the actual
composition of the memoir. It refers to his testimony to a Congressional
committee against a former friend of his.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought what a terrible thing I'd done: not the political aspect of
it, because maybe that was correct, but it didn't matter now, correct
or not; all that mattered was the human side of the thing. I said to
myself, "You hurt another human being, a friend of yours and his
familiy, and no 'political aspect' matters two shits." (Elia Kazan, &lt;em&gt;A
Life&lt;/em&gt;, [N.p.: Da Capo Press, 1997], p. 685)&lt;/p&gt;

than one of their numbers to be forwarded to any particular phone
number. That means that if I have several visitors staying with me, no
more than one of them can have his calls forwarded to my home number via
Google Voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second restriction is one I described in &lt;a href="http://brannerchinese.wordpress.com/2012/04/29/a-stricture-on-google-voice/" title="A stricture on Google Voice"&gt;an earlier post&lt;/a&gt;: that
call-forwarding cannot cross national boundaries. I can see that that
prevents people from getting around international phone charges, but the
rule applies even between the US and Canada, and at the moment US-Canada
phone calls are subject to no charges on Google Voice. So in this
respect call-forwarding is actually more restricted than ordinary phone
service is.&lt;/p&gt;

about the protesting students, who have been upset about what my
interlocutors describe as a very small tuition increase — much smaller
than the 25% per year that CUNY is going to be undergoing starting in a
few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were smoke bombs thrown in the subway one morning we were there —
the entire system was shut down during rush hour — and earlier there had
been bags of bricks thrown on the tracks, with the same result. Riot
police used tear gas and percussion grenades against protesters some
weeks before we got there. Faculty and students tell me they have been
heckled by protesters, some wearing masks, while trying to enter
buildings. (The Montréal city government has proposed banning the
covering of one's face during a protest, and the Canadian government is
considering a similar law.) So much class time was lost at some
institutions that exams have been postponed and at least one campus
(Université de Montréal) has canceled graduation ceremonies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is most interesting about this is the clear divide between
linguistic-cultural affiliations of the students involved — it is "the
French" who are said to believe they are entitled to free education,
while some (only some) of the others whose opinions I heard in person or
read in the papers want to see the army brought in to deal with the
situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feelings about free tuition were once high at CUNY, too. Here is a 2010
description from the New York Times:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CUNY colleges once were known as theaters of unrest. In 1970, students
shut off elevator service at Hunter College and liberated the
cafeteria by serving free food. Helmeted police officers were called,
and classes were suspended. In 1976, as CUNY finally faced an end to
free tuition, students marched in the streets of Harlem and boycotted
classes for three days, while 13 members of the English faculty
started a hunger strike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1989, the possibility of tuition increases led students at City
College to pour glue and stick toothpicks into the locks of 400
classrooms. Students seized administration buildings and blocked
traffic across the city. In 1991, another series of protests prompted
classes to be canceled and commencement to be delayed. (&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/20/nyregion/20cuny.html?pagewanted=all"&gt;The New York
Times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, December 20, 2010, p. A23)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some other documents here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="http://digital-archives.ccny.cuny.edu/thecampus/1967/SEPTEMBER_121_4/00000043.PDF"&gt;26 September, 1967, issue of &lt;em&gt;The Campus&lt;/em&gt;, the CCNY paper&lt;/a&gt;,
    reporting and commenting on the decision to end free tuition. See
    "Compromise Termed 'Sellout' by Head of Alumni Group" (pp. 1-2) and
    "A CU Grows in Brooklyn" (p. 2). More issues of &lt;em&gt;The Campus&lt;/em&gt; may be
    found at the same site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www1.cuny.edu/mu/forum/2011/10/12/when-tuition-at-cuny-was-free-sort-of/"&gt;"When Tuition at CUNY was Free, Sort of,"&lt;/a&gt; a 2011 account of the
    older tuition system and its replacement by financial aid. This
    account appeared as CUNY was preparing to announce tuition
    increases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My view is that when something good — education, for example — has a
cost to me, I tend to take it more seriously. That goes for both tuition
and homework. I am not arguing in favor of exorbitant tuition or
unreasonable workloads, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also found that people who audit my classes never do all the work
assigned, even when they're strongly motivated, and almost always stop
attending before the end of the term. It seems to me that the absence of
grade-pressure prevents most people from exerting themselves as much as
they might.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Call-screening in Google Voice has a problem</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/call-screening-in-google-voice-has-a-problem.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-05-15T21:33:00-04:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2012-05-15:call-screening-in-google-voice-has-a-problem.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="http://support.google.com/voice/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;amp;answer=115083"&gt;current version of its call-screening help page&lt;/a&gt; ,
Google stores callers' spoken names the first time they leave them, and
then reuses those names when a call arrives later from the same number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that assumes it is the always same person calling from a given
number. That is not a safe assumption by any means, and in effect, it
disables the call-screening function because you can't rely on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If many different people call from a single phone number — from an
organization, say, or a shared phone — you have no way of screening by
caller, only by number. That's not really call-screening — it's
essentially just the same thing as caller ID. Call-screening is when I
decide whether I want to take the call depending on who is actually
calling, not what number they're using.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Cortlandt Alley's Chinese name</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/cortlandt-alleys-chinese-name.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-05-15T12:31:00-04:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2012-05-15:cortlandt-alleys-chinese-name.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Cortlandt Alley, a short and very narrow passage running south of Canal

CUNY trustee and community activist. He held a degree in film-making as

on Rue de la Gauchetière and two big ones on Boulévard Saint-Laurent.
The small ones are older; their writing (&lt;em&gt;Mǎndìkě Huábù&lt;/em&gt; 滿地可華埠
'Montréal Chinatown') runs right to left and they were already erected
when we last visited this city, in 1998. The new ones date from 1999 and
bear heavy metal plaques listing many dignitaries involved in their
erection, including the Mayor of Shanghai at the time, Xú Kuāngdí
徐匡迪. Now 75 years old, Xú has had a long career as a professor of
engineering but remains active in Chinese political life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of the large gateways read &lt;em&gt;Tángrénjiē&lt;/em&gt; 唐人街 'Chinatown' on the
outside. Inside the northwestern one it says &lt;em&gt;zhǒngshì zēnghuá&lt;/em&gt; 踵事增華
'to inherit a [great] task and increase the level of talent [applied to
it]' and inside the southeastern one it says &lt;em&gt;zhōnglíng yùxiù&lt;/em&gt; 鍾靈毓秀
'for concentrated spiritual power to cultivate excellence'.&lt;/p&gt;

finding the names of Chinese restaurants with unalloyedly good reviews
on Chinese discussion sites. There were many references to
all-you-can-eat dives, where one pays bottom dollar for strong-tasting
recipes cooked using ingredients of the lowest possible quality.
Obviously, anyone who would recommend such a place is not serious about
getting good food. One commentator even said "没有一间好吃" [there isn't
a single good place] in Montréal. However, with some persistence we
found Màixiāngyuán cānguǎn 麥香園餐館, an excellent dumpling parlor in
Chinatown. The name Mai Xiang Yuan means "the garden of wheaten aroma".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owned by people from Dàlián 大連 in the former Manchuria, Mai Xiang Yuan
offers some 30 varieties of &lt;em&gt;boulettes&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;shuǐjiǎo&lt;/em&gt; 水餃 'dumplings',
rendered &lt;em&gt;ravioles&lt;/em&gt; by the francophone press). These dumplings may be
ordered boiled or pan-fried, as well as cooked in soup, and you get
fifteen to an order. There is a smaller range available at lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ordered the lamb and onion and the beef and celery dumplings, both of
which were delicious, with a good balance of animal and vegetable
flavors, dumpling-skins cooked to perfect &lt;em&gt;al dente&lt;/em&gt; texture, and
apparently meat of decent quality. These are philosophically sound
&lt;em&gt;boulettes Chinoises&lt;/em&gt;, in my judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lunch menu also has a vegetarian offering, and beyond that there are
some salads. Of these, we had the &lt;em&gt;jièwèi sānsī&lt;/em&gt; 芥味三絲 [three
mustard-flavored shredded things] combining slivers of bokchoy
(&lt;em&gt;dàbáicài&lt;/em&gt; 大白菜), fried egg, carrots, and rice vermicelli (&lt;em&gt;mǐfěn&lt;/em&gt;
米粉), in a mild white vinegar-and-wasabi dressing with a hint of sesame
oil apparent, and barely sweetened. This little salad was so good at the
start of the meal that we ordered it again at the end, and it left us
wishing only to be hungry once more so we could go back to try more
kinds of &lt;em&gt;boulettes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mai Xiang Yuan's address is 1084 Boulévard Saint-Laurent and its phone
number is the distinctively Chinese (514)-875-1888. At the moment,
Google Street View shows a previous tenant of the space, Épicerie Thiên
Phat 天發雜貨, but the address is not hard to find. The proprietress
suggests visiting outside of the hours 5:30-7:00 pm, when the place is
mobbed. We counted 34 seats at 17 small tables; on our arrival at 2 pm
on a weekday there were perhaps ten guests already engaged in
boulette-demolition. We put away thirty dumplings and two small plates
of the salad, paying about CA\$25 for everything, including a generous
contribution of 15% sales tax to the Canadian economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be back before long, I feel sure.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>A bon mot of Peter Carey about reviews of one's work (2012)</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/a-bon-mot-of-peter-carey-about-reviews-of-ones-work-2012.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-05-09T16:34:00-04:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2012-05-09:a-bon-mot-of-peter-carey-about-reviews-of-ones-work-2012.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Peter Carey:&lt;/p&gt;

command line to set the particular bridge adapter required to run
VirtualBox, resolving an error that aborts start-up of the virtual
machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which adapter is in use depends on how the host machine is expecting to
connect to the internet, even if it is not actually connected at the
moment. Different airport and ethernet cards identify themselves using
(in theory) different MAC addresses and will be assigned different BSD
interface names, "en0", "en1", and so on. (These names are always of the
format [letters][integer].) Since interface names are assigned at system
start-up, they may occasionally be different from what you are used to
seeing, so it is not a good idea to treat them as fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To direct VirtualBox to use a particular interface — &lt;code&gt;en0&lt;/code&gt;, for instance
— for a virtual machine "himself", use&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;vboxmanage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;modifyvm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;himself&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;nic1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;bridged&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bridgeadapter1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;en0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;at the command line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But sometimes it isn't easy to figure out which interface to use. On
models of MacBook Air that have no built-in ethernet card, an external
(USB) ethernet adapter is needed, and different USB adapters will have
different MAC addresses, meaning that they will each be assigned
different interface names. How do you know which interface name should
be passed to VirtualBox?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Active interface names are reported by the network interface
configuration tool &lt;code&gt;ifconfig&lt;/code&gt; when run without options. You can pipe
that output through &lt;code&gt;awk&lt;/code&gt; to return just the active &lt;code&gt;en-&lt;/code&gt; interface name
to standard output:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ifconfig&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;awk&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;F&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/^&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;en&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you like, you can pass the output of that whole expression to
&lt;code&gt;vboxmanage&lt;/code&gt; in a one-line instruction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;vboxmanage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;modifyvm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;himself&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;nic1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;bridged&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bridgeadapter1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ifconfig&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;awk&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;F&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/^&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;en&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;That should configure VirtualBox correctly so that the virtual machine
will boot successfully. The only caveat is that if the virtual machine

adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, the U.S. administration was carefully raising the
possibility of selling weapons to Taiwan. There are reasons to think the
U.S. no longer trusts the independence of Taiwan's military, and if so,
then that was surely intended to be a bargaining chip to be ceded to
China during the upcoming military discussions. Well, that whole set of
preparations has been scuttled by Chén Guāngchéng's move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have the impression that Chén's gambit now leaves the US on the
defensive in its military negotiations. Having been obliged to take up a
pro-human rights position reminiscent of the first Cold War, it now has
no capital left for other gambits. The timing of Chén's adventure
couldn't have been more effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I suspect his escape from house arrest and somewhat hysterical
attacks on the US after leaving the embassy were engineered by some
third party. His playing of US actors against each other — the
Republicans against the Democrats and the Congress against the
Administration — does not look like the way a powerless asylum-seeker
would behave. What it looks like is manipulation, and I suspect forces
much more skilled and cynical than Chén were behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder if those forces were not in fact Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Military officers who cannot count</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/military-officers-who-cannot-count.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-05-02T20:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2012-05-02:military-officers-who-cannot-count.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This from a US reporter in Afghanistan:&lt;/p&gt;

trying to train the Afghans up to, for the soldiers, to a first-grade

a lot of these soldiers cannot only not read or write but many can't
even count, and the US tries to get around this in some novel ways.
I'll give you a good example. They actually draw a rectangle in the
dirt for [a commander] who can't tell how many soldiers he has, or
should have, and the Americans tell him that, listen, if the soldiers
standing at attention fill this rectangle in the dirt, [he] would now

version of Ubuntu server, installed as a guest OS on VirtualBox. For
maximum efficiency and minimum waste of CPU time, I run the server from
the command line (using &lt;code&gt;vboxmanage startvm&lt;/code&gt;) and then &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt; into the
server as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes a normally well-behaved VM spontaneously refuses to run,
generating the strange error &lt;code&gt;VERR_INTNET_FLT_IF_NOT_FOUND&lt;/code&gt;, which is
undocumented in the User Manual that comes with VirtualBox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If running the VirtualBox GUI, the error typically looks like this,
    for a VM named &lt;code&gt;himself&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code style="font-size:12px;"&gt;Failed to open a session for the virtual machine himself.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Failed to open/create the internal network
'HostInterfaceNetworking-en2: USB Ethernet 2'
(VERR_INTNET_FLT_IF_NOT_FOUND).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Failed to attach the network LUN
(VERR_INTNET_FLT_IF_NOT_FOUND).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Result Code: NS_ERROR_FAILURE (0x80004005)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Interface: IConsole {1968b7d3-e3bf-4ceb-99e0-cb7c913317bb}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the command line, the error typically looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code style="font-size:12px;"&gt;vboxmanage: error: Failed to open/create the internal network 'HostInterfaceNetworking-en2: USB Ethernet 2' (VERR_INTNET_FLT_IF_NOT_FOUND).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VBoxManage: error: Failed to attach the network LUN
(VERR_INTNET_FLT_IF_NOT_FOUND)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
VBoxManage: error: Details: code NS_ERROR_FAILURE (0x80004005),
component Console, interface IConsole, callee &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution is to reset the networking settings for the VM. I use the
following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;vboxmanage modifyvm himself --nic1 bridged\&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--bridgeadapter1 en1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where &lt;code&gt;nic1&lt;/code&gt; resets the &lt;strong&gt;n&lt;/strong&gt;etworking mode to "&lt;strong&gt;i&lt;/strong&gt;nternal &lt;strong&gt;c&lt;/strong&gt;ard 1"
(the indices appended to &lt;code&gt;nic&lt;/code&gt; and other options start at 1) and
&lt;code&gt;bridgeadapter1&lt;/code&gt; resets the first adapter to &lt;code&gt;en1&lt;/code&gt;, which is normally
ethernet on my system, although it is best to check and make sure
because it is sometimes &lt;code&gt;en0&lt;/code&gt;. This Bridge Adapter setting is what
sometimes seems to change without apparent actions on my part. Note that
the &lt;code&gt;bridgeadapter1&lt;/code&gt; option has no effect without the &lt;code&gt;nic&lt;/code&gt; option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple headless start-up from the command line looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;prompt$ vboxheadless -startvm himself&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waiting for VM "himself" to power on...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VM "himself" has been successfully started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;prompt\$ &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The additional option &lt;code&gt;--vrde=off&lt;/code&gt; prevents running the standard remote
display protocol server, which does not seem to be necessary for
anything I do on my system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For more information&lt;/strong&gt;: The sections "Bridged Networking" and
"Internal Networking" of the User Manual are useful to read. For
command-line option, see the "Commands Overview" section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I like to have Ubuntu available to me on my laptop. Rather than
    install Ubuntu Desktop, as I have in the past, I've installed only
    the server and now &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt; into it from my laptop. This turns out to
    be much less CPU-intensive to operate. There is no need to install
    Guest Additions (can't be installed, anyway) and you can
    cut/copy/paste directly from your Terminal window if you need to.
    The only small hitch is that you cannot use the mouse or host OS
    clipboards inside VirtualBox's own window for the guest OS — but you
    won't need to after the initial installation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, all my scripts and code from 10.04 work without any observed
    hitches on 12.04. The only problem I have had is with the &lt;code&gt;halt&lt;/code&gt;
    command, which leaves the virtual OS shut down but hanging. This can
    be avoided by using&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;poweroff&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
. The &lt;code&gt;poweroff&lt;/code&gt; command requires you to specify a time for
shutdown; using &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; (minutes) is marginally less work to type than
&lt;code&gt;now&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since my router authenticates MAC addresses, it's easiest simply to
    assign the same MAC address manually to each VB installation on a
    given laptop. It would not be very feasible to run more than one of
    these at the same time, because of memory considerations — so
    there's little chance of conflict between them. MAC addresses are
    set at&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Settings&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Network&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Adapter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;etc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Advanced&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
. All VirtualBox installations seem to use the same MAC prefix
080027, so you only need to specify the same final six hex digits.
Of course, you can set up an entirely different prefix if you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

students have been reading, at
&lt;a href="https://brannerchinese.com/w3302_2012spring/recordings/"&gt;https://brannerchinese.com/w3302_2012spring/recordings/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is not enough of this in the teaching of Classical Chinese — well,
there is not enough Classical Chinese in Chinese programs generally,
because many people fail to understand the centrality of "Classical" and
literary Chinese in the structure and aesthetics of modern Mandarin. I
won't preach about that here. What I want to assert now is how important
the reading aloud of texts is to learning the language they contain.
Hearing another person reading them aloud is also good, and so to aid my
students (who I require to read aloud everything we study together, from
a clean copy of the text projected on a screen) I made my own
recordings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I prefaced the fifty-odd recordings in this set with these comments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recognize that these recordings are quite helpful to you, and that
is why I have prepared them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I have misgivings about them. For one thing, they force me to
commit myself to particular character-readings and syntactic
expression in stress, whereas I prefer to keep my relationship to the
text more fluid. For another, they rob you of the chance to decide for
yourself how to interpret the text, in just those ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, though, I think it is better for you to have these to
review from, in case they are of use to you for that purpose. I hope
to find time to prepare more in the next days and weeks. They are not
as good as an educative native speaker might produce, but I suspect
they will still be useful. They may also be rather soft unless you
listen to them with headphones or a properly amplified system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bear in mind that these readings reflect (a) the specific versions of
the texts that I have used in the course, ignoring what may be in your
textbooks or other versions, and (b) my best choice of readings based
on the various considerations that I consider relevant. Both
undoubtedly differ considerably from what you may encounter elsewhere,
and I urge you to listen widely and read aloud adventurously. I lean
to the 1932 standard of Mandarin rather than the mid-1950s standard,
though not in every case, and for certain words I prefer a more
conservative reading (&lt;em&gt;jū&lt;/em&gt; rather than &lt;em&gt;jù&lt;/em&gt; for 俱, &lt;em&gt;dài&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;em&gt;dà&lt;/em&gt; 大
but only in the two compounds 大王 and 大夫, etc. etc. etc.).
Generally I have avoided the old &lt;em&gt;rùshēng&lt;/em&gt; 入聲 readings (&lt;em&gt;zé&lt;/em&gt; for
&lt;em&gt;zhái&lt;/em&gt; 宅, &lt;em&gt;bò&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;em&gt;běi&lt;/em&gt; 北, etc. etc.), dear though they are to my
heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To choose one's own readings is an expression of temperament as well
as understanding. My own tendencies are mainly philological and will
probably not inspire you much. But if you have the time and interest,
I recommend listening to the work of Mr. Hung Tzeh-nan 洪澤南老師, the
most gifted performer of oral Classical Chinese literature I have yet
encountered. Unfortunately, most of his work is not easy to get hold
of, but his book &lt;em&gt;Ták-ê lâi gîm-si&lt;/em&gt; 大家來吟詩 is on-line at &lt;a href="http://cls.hs.yzu.edu.tw/300/all/media/poem/poem.htm"&gt;Yuan Ze
University 元智大學's site&lt;/a&gt;. It is true that these materials are in
Taiwanese rather than Mandarin, but they illustrate the basic nature
of the oral performance of Classical Chinese literature: that it is to
the reading of a text what &lt;em&gt;shūfǎ&lt;/em&gt; 書法 (brush-pen calligraphy) is to
the physical characters — an individual expression of understanding
and mood, ranging from the exquisite heights of fine art down to (one
hopes, at least) workmanlike presentation. Unfortunately, my reading
has no artistic content, but I urge you to explore Mr. Hung's work
when you have time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the computer is so powerful a resource that it can be programmed to
simulate the instructional process, shouldn’t we be teaching our
students mastery of this powerful intellectual tool? Is it enough that
a student be the subject of computer administered instruction—the
end-user of a new technology? Or should his education also include
learning to use the computer (1) to get information in the social
sciences from a large database inquiry system, or (2) to simulate an
ecological system, or (3) to solve problems by using algorithms, or
(4) to acquire laboratory data and analyze it, or (5) to represent
textual information for editing and analysis, or (6) to represent
musical information for analysis, or (7) to create and process
graphical information? These uses of computers in education cause

Donald Knuth's symbol Θ ("big theta") in asymptotic notation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think a lot of the blocking is done by people of very low
decision-making authority who have been placed fortuitously in a
position of power — often high school and college students working for
pennies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So maybe it doesn't mean much — isn't being done by people answering to
a political authority, just by low-level functionaries trying to look
busy.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>The experience of learning vim commands</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/the-experience-of-learning-vim-commands.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-04-04T18:40:00-04:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2012-04-04:the-experience-of-learning-vim-commands.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;There seem to be two different compartments in my brain for clusters of

"words", and that's how they remain in my head. I can access them fast
as words, almost by reflex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other compartment is accretionary. I never thought of &lt;code&gt;ggVG&lt;/code&gt; (for
selecting the whole contents of a file) as a command cluster until I saw
it in print, but when I did I recognized it at once as something I type
all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

into "4-5 years".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cursor over "3", C-a increments it to "4". Good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cursor over the "4" after the hyphen, C-a surprisingly decrements it to
"3". Repeating the action eventually produces "40 years" (hyphen
deleted), after which C-a increments properly to "41 years", etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curious. I suppose vim is treating "4-4" as subtraction rather than a
date range. "4-3" is indeed one more than "4-4".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tested the idea by replacing my all-purpose ASCII hyphen with an
en-dash, – (&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;ndash;&lt;/code&gt;). In that case, C-a increments 4–4 to 4–5 as
expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn't explain why "4-1" becomes "40" when the "1" is decremented,
though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update, 20120404&lt;/em&gt;: It has been pointed out to me that vim must be
looking no further to the left than the hyphen, treating "4" and "-3" as
separate numbers. After "-1" has been incremented to "0", it is seen
together with "4" as part of the number "40", which is then incremented
to "41".&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Alexandra Lord on the myth of the academic career (2012)</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/alexandra-lord-on-the-myth-of-the-academic-career-2012.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-03-27T21:25:00-04:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2012-03-27:alexandra-lord-on-the-myth-of-the-academic-career-2012.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Describing the things that led her to create the &lt;a href="http://www.beyondacademe.com/"&gt;Beyond Academe&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students need to understand that the university is not the only place
where one can live the life of the mind. Believing that myth is what
leads smart undergraduates to rush to graduate school and is what
prevents doctoral students from exploring varied careers with an open
mind. A good start would be to acknowledge that there are many ways to
live the life of the mind, that nonacademic careers are so diverse as
to defy simple characterizations, and that neither a Ph.D. nor an
academic position are prerequisites to writing and publishing
excellent scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is troubling to realize that so many academics seem determined to
create or, more simply, maintain an artificial wall between the
academic and nonacademic worlds, even when it is against their
interests to do so. Equally troubling is the passive acceptance, and
even nurturing, of an academic culture that tells students that a
lifetime of underemployment as an adjunct or an unhappy professor is
preferable to — more honorable than — life as a nonacademic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Anatolian Greeks are completely terrorised people. My father's
family comes from the interior of Asia Minor, from a city called
Kayseri, and they never forgot they were part of a minority. They were
surrounded with periodic slaughters — or riots: the Turks would suddenly
have a crisis and massacre a lot of Armenians, or they'd run wild and
kill a lot of Greeks. The Greeks stayed in their houses. The fronts of
the houses were almost barricaded, the windows shut with wooden
shutters. One of the first memories I have is of sleeping in my
grandmother's bed and my grandmother telling me stories about the
massacre of the Armenians, and how she and my grandfather hid Armenians
in the cellar of their home … The Armenians were lustier, their history
a much bolder, more rebellious one. The Greeks were crafty, they did not
rebel and they did not get killed as much. … [In America, m]y father
traded in rugs. He was brought to this country by my uncle, who had a
great deal of energy and cunning. They say the Jews have cunning, that
they're sly people: the Anatolian Greeks are the same kind of people. If
you want to know why: they couldn't protect themselves by force, by the
sword or by arms, they were constantly being demeaned, so the only way
they could get along was by being sly, by never saying the wrong thing.
The first thing I learned was to shut up. My father used to tell us:
'Say nothing, don't mix in, don't mix in other people's business, stay
out of trouble,' and that of course was the very opposite of the Yankee
tradition. My first wife was a Yankee; her tradition was never to say
anything except exactly what you felt and say it immediately without any
omission or qualification. That's one of the reasons I admired and loved
her so much: she was the opposite of the way I was brought up. But I was
cautious and careful and crafty."&lt;/p&gt;

Python dictionary &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt;, with its keys populated from unique members of a
list &lt;code&gt;list_of_counters&lt;/code&gt; and its values set uniformly to 0:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fromkeys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list_of_counters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I used &lt;code&gt;set()&lt;/code&gt; to ensure that only one unique copy of each element of
&lt;code&gt;list_of_counters&lt;/code&gt; was used, and all went well. Each item in the
dictionary functioned as an independent counter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, I realized that I needed to keep track of two things for each
counter, rather than one. No problem; I replaced the 0 above with a list
&lt;code&gt;[0, 0]&lt;/code&gt;, one index for each thing to be kept track of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fromkeys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list_of_counters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Disaster! Every time I updated one index for any particular item, the
same index was changed for all the items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My error was to use a list to populate a dictionary's values using a
single list. Since lists are mutable objects in Python, they are passed
by reference. So there was only a single list being used as the value
for all the keys in the dictionary; when one copy of it was updated, all
were changed to match it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution is to populate the initial values using a loop, rather than
all at once. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fromkeys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list_of_counters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A comprehension can also be used. In the intial creation of the
dictionary, the values can be left empty.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Is blocking ads theft of service?</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/is-blocking-ads-a-theft-of-service.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-03-12T18:29:00-04:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2012-03-12:is-blocking-ads-a-theft-of-service.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Readers sometimes write to ask how a certain ad got onto my blog.

on airlines now, when you first board — I feel I should be paid for the

yourself, my feeling is you're stealing from me unless you compensate me
satisfactorily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But no, blocking ads is not theft of service unless seeing those ads is
made an explicit condition of accessing some service. And if it is, I
will probably not use that service or visit that site, just as I don't
watch commercial television any more (I stopped around 15 years ago).&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>A poor analogy on intellectual property rights</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/a-poor-analogy-on-intellectual-property-rights.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-03-12T18:24:00-04:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2012-03-12:a-poor-analogy-on-intellectual-property-rights.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A friend sent me a link to &lt;a href="http://paulgraham.com/property.html"&gt;Paul Graham's recounting of the old story&lt;/a&gt;
of the poor student who enjoyed the smell of fish cooking in the
restaurant next door, and who was sued by the restaurant-owner, who
claimed the student was stealing the smell of his food. Graham uses the
story to suggest that intellectual property rights are subject to an
evolving definition and implies (though he doesn't say it in so many
words) that they are evanescent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is a poor analogy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The owner of the shop is not selling smells; he is selling food and the
smells escape freely from it, the same as from the food other people
sell. He does not usually charge for smells or even, under normal
circumstances, treat them as a commodity. There is no comparison to
intellectual property (except perhaps to people who can't tell the
difference between creative work and the smell of cooked fish).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A better analogy would be if I bought your products and offered them as
free gifts for new customers at my bank. I have the right to do that
since I've paid for them. But I can't pretend that there is no condition
to be met in order to receive a gift, and I would be insincere if I said
my entire goal was to distribute your products. But that is exactly what
the advertising industry does by using Internet search results as a lure
to expose us to targeted ads and subject us to data-mining. It is still
possible to avoid the ads — you can use tools like &lt;a href="http://brannerchinese.wordpress.com/2012/02/06/adblock-plus-is-the-most-useful-piece-of-shareware-ive-ever-had/" title="Adblock Plus is the most useful piece of shareware I’ve ever had"&gt;Adblock Plus&lt;/a&gt; and
you can conduct all your web-searches through a browser that doesn't
link searches to a known login (I like &lt;a href="http://www.icab.de/dl.php"&gt;iCab&lt;/a&gt; for this purpose, while
logged into accounts on more mainstream browsers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graham's post is primarily about "labels and studios", the high end of
the entertainment business, which are a primary force behind the
perpetual extension of copyright in the United States, the fictitious
electronic security that is an increasing drag on our economy, and
recent legal threats to end the freedom of the Internet. "Labels and
studios" are easy to vilify. But the idea of intellectual property
doesn't belong to them, and not everyone who owns intellectual property
is guilty of their excesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To pretend otherwise is disingenuous and provides tacit support to the
huge, powerful technology/advertising companies that now treat the
entire content of the Internet as a resource with which to make money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://brannerchinese.com/dpb/publications.html"&gt;I make all my work freely available on the internet&lt;/a&gt;, but it remains
copyright and its use is not free in the sense "unencumbered", even
though it is free in the sense "freely accessible" and may be copied at
will for individual reading and study. There's a clear statement of this
principle on the site. My feeling is that if you use my stuff to make
money, you owe me a cut.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>A mutton chop at Keen's Steakhouse</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/a-mutton-chop-at-keens-steakhouse.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-03-11T08:03:00-04:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2012-03-11:a-mutton-chop-at-keens-steakhouse.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The best restaurant meal I have had in some time was served to me two

Wesleyan:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russell B. Miller (the object of much conniving because he owned the

to read the text and translate the passage into English, but for a
long time, he did not call on the lone Chinese student in the class.
When he finally did, Hung stood up and gleefully recited the whole
chapter, from memory, in Greek! He never called on Hung to translate
again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;locale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;setlocale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;locale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;LC_ALL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;listname&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sorted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;listname&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cmp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;locale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;strcoll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;which seems to work. My encoding is set to &lt;code&gt;en_US.UTF-8&lt;/code&gt;, which treats
&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;ā&lt;/em&gt; as the same letter; that's what I want for sorting in
this particular case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could also specify the encoding, but according to the Python docs at
[http://docs.python.org/release/2.6.6/library/locale.html?highlight=locale#locale.setlocale][],
it seems the actual encoding can be left out and supplied from one's
environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's what the empty single quotes are; but they need to be there
because &lt;code&gt;setlocale()&lt;/code&gt; takes a 2-tuple. Trying that on my system returns
'en_US.UTF-8'. If I omit the single quotes altogether, the function
returns 'C' and the sort is case sensitive.&lt;/p&gt;

is by using the &lt;code&gt;with&lt;/code&gt; statement:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;read&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;some&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;other&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;things&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;with&lt;/code&gt; statement ensures that the file's exit code is executed,
closing the file no matter what interruptions may take place. That
prevents files from becoming locked unexpectedly. Some people suggest
embedding the whole &lt;code&gt;with&lt;/code&gt; block in a &lt;code&gt;try-except&lt;/code&gt; block to catch
exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there is one disaster that may befall you even when using
&lt;code&gt;with&lt;/code&gt;. If you open an existing file with a mode of &lt;code&gt;'w'&lt;/code&gt; (write)
instead of &lt;code&gt;'r'&lt;/code&gt; (read), the content of the file will be completely
overwritten, even if you do nothing to the file other than open it for
writing. It will have a size of 0 and no content at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since you have probably typed a mode of &lt;code&gt;'w'&lt;/code&gt; inadvertently, there is no
point recommending the use of other modes as safeties. The safest way to
avoid this problem is to ensure that the file you are reading from is
backed up somewhere. That way, if you type &lt;code&gt;'w'&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;'r'&lt;/code&gt;, you
will still have an easy way to recover.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Reloading a Python module after modifying it</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/reloading-a-python-module-after-modifying-it.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-03-03T21:57:00-05:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2012-03-03:reloading-a-python-module-after-modifying-it.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;If a module is being tested while in the midst of development, it has to
be reloaded into a running interpreter in order for its most current
version to be available to the interpreter. Use the &lt;code&gt;reload()&lt;/code&gt; function
for this. Note that although the initial &lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt; is a statement,
meaning that there are no parentheses around what follows it, &lt;code&gt;reload()&lt;/code&gt;
is a function, not a statement, and so there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; parentheses around
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ipython (v. 0.12) and the normal Python interpreter (v. 2.6.5) handle
this in slightly different ways. Supposing you have a program
&lt;code&gt;my_module.py&lt;/code&gt; whose functions you want to import, and you do so (as I
almost always do) using a shorter, alternate name, like "M":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;my_module&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If &lt;code&gt;my_module&lt;/code&gt; undergoes changes that you want to make use of, in the
regular Python interactive mode you have two choices: &lt;strong&gt;(1)&lt;/strong&gt; you can
simply use&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;reload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;my_module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;my_module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;my_module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pyc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;or &lt;strong&gt;(2)&lt;/strong&gt; you can use alternate name you imported the module as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;reload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;my_module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;my_module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pyc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Python accepts either name as the argument of &lt;code&gt;reload()&lt;/code&gt;, as shown by
its response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Ipython, however, only the second of these works &lt;strong&gt;(2)&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;my_module&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="cp"&gt;# (now my_module undergoes changes that you want to make use of)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;reload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;Out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;my_module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;my_module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pyc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The first &lt;strong&gt;(1)&lt;/strong&gt; will generate an error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;reload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;my_module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nl"&gt;NameError:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;my_module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;defined&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Python 3, &lt;code&gt;reload()&lt;/code&gt; has been assigned to the &lt;code&gt;imp&lt;/code&gt; module, for

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it is extremely valuable to combine the development of
software (actually anything) with the task of writing about it in some
way. Trying to explain to others the functions and concepts behind a
creation helps a lot in finding out whether or not something is going
to work in practice. If you can’t explain it or if the explanation
turns out to be horribly complicated, then there is something
fundamentally wrong with your creation and you should return to the
drawing board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very important here is that one does not stop at simply documenting
functions or menu items (though that is a start) but effectively tries
to document the usage flow and the reasons why one would do things in
one way or the other. Often enough (with free software as well as
commercial software) you find only rudimentary documentation that
tells you that such and such feature exists but never explains why one
would want to use the feature in the first place. That type of
documentation, while necessary, will not help in improving your tool
(and often enough it turns out that such features only got implemented
because they were easy to add without providing any real benefit).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yes, documenting ideas and work flows has always been an integral
part for me of developing and/or improving software, both my own as
well as software from others. In The LATEX Companion, for example, a
good proportion of what I describe is software developed by others,
and the process of trying to explain how to use this software and
finding good usage examples led in many cases to improvements in
syntax or features after some discussions with the authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore my advice to developers is to always try their hands at
documenting their own creations or at least find somebody who does it
for them (starting from the initial development!) — and carefully
evaluate the findings from this process: it will result in noticeable
improvements in the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do indeed like to collaborate and over the years worked successfully
with many different people (on various topics and in different subject
domains). For me the main value of collaboration is during the
development of ideas which, in my experience, are best produced in an
open exchange. My mental picture here is a table tennis or similar
game which only develops if one directly reacts to whatever your
counterpart thinks of and “picks up the ball as played”. People who
have worked with me know that I like white board drawing sessions (I
do need to visualize while I play along) and brainstorming and mind
mapping methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’m also a stickler for details and can spend a lot of energy and
effort in actually finishing something (to my own satisfaction) when I
consider it worthwhile. Collaboration on that level — after the
initial concept and design development work has finished and the nitty
gritty detail work starts — normally takes one of two forms: either I
restrict myself largely to mentoring and let others work on actual
implementations, or I put so much energy into a certain task that it
outweighs other people’s involvement by a large factor. My base motto
here is “&lt;em&gt;Es gibt nichts Gutes, außer man tut es&lt;/em&gt;” (free translation:
Nothing good will come into existence unless you actually do it) by
Erich Kästner which at least in the German language nicely rhymes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of collaboration necessarily happens via email (due to living in
different countries, etc.), but I find it extremely valuable to
interrupt this method of working at irregular intervals with
face-to-face meetings to flesh out ideas and make them concrete enough
to go ahead for a while in semi-isolation with only email and or phone
calls as the means of “direct” communication. This also explains why
most of the more fundamental work that is associated with Rainer
Schöpf’s and my names dates from the time when we both studied at the
University and had a chance for a more regular exchange of ideas in
front of white boards (drinking gallons of tea).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;perhaps the most curious license ever drawn up, in that I required …

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

standard LaTeX distribution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~~~~ {style="font-size:small;"}
%%  Users of multicol who wish to include or use multicol or a modified&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;%%  version in a proprietary and commercially market product are asked&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;%%  under certain conditions (see below) for the payment of a license&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;%%  fee.  The size of this fee is to be determined, in each instance,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Multicol&lt;/code&gt; enables segments of different numbers of columns to appear on
the same page, along with other functionality helpful in formatting
columns. I have used this package in typesetting Jerry Norman's Manchu

letter-section in an otherwise two-column text. For example: [![Jerry

To me,
one of the most brilliant is the contact that took place between
European serialism and African-American jazz. The linchpin of the
contact was the book by Nicolas Slonimsky (1894–1995), &lt;em&gt;A Thesaurus of
Scales and Melodic Patterns&lt;/em&gt; (1947), which introduced large numbers of
scales and other patterns built of intervals in non-traditional
combinations. Slonimsky described the beginnings of his project in his
memoir, &lt;em&gt;Perfect Pitch&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parallel to my exploration of musical exotica, an idea began to form
in my restless mind whether an entirely new taxonomy of scales and
melodic patterns could not be formed outside major and minor
modalities. … I viewed the entire evolution of musical composition
before the present as a constricting course limited to the arbitrary
compass of seven diatonic degrees, with occasional chromatics growing
inside and outside a given mode. The antiphonal strength of modulatory
processes and fugal imitation had its source in the unequal division
of the octave into two parts, from the tonic to the dominant and from
the dominant to the tonic, leading to non-symmetric procedures.
&lt;em&gt;Oxford University Press, 1988, Chapter 16, "Interpolation:
Grossmutterakkord", p. 172&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://whalenatorsblog.blogspot.com/"&gt;Keith Whalen, a Montréal guitarist&lt;/a&gt;, has recorded a number of the
scales that are suited to the guitar, as part of his wider study of
scales and tonalities. It is useful to have this material in recorded
form, and I am very grateful to Whalen. Here are a couple of examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Heptatonic and Bitonal Arpeggios:
    &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMHfNAFv9vk"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMHfNAFv9vk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other recordings of related material around, too, but Whalen's
is fairly extensive.&lt;/p&gt;

culture — it is where many of us go to get regular doses of better
Chinese food than we can make ourselves, and for some kind of validation
of our Chinese identities. But here and there you can find the real
&lt;em&gt;zìjī&lt;/em&gt; 字跡 of famous calligraphers. Here are four, which I've
supplemented with links to Robert K. Chin's superb website:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hu Shih [Hú Shì] 胡適, intellectual historian, on the doorway of the

&lt;p&gt;Chairman Mao [Máo Zhǔxí] 毛主席, on the sign of the Xīnhuá Bookstore
新华书店, 9 Elizabeth St. (west side of street). "新华书店" [Xīnhuá

store's signs around the world, so this is rather less distinctive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd be glad to hear of any others, and I'll list them here. Or if you
have more detailed photographs, those would be nice, too.&lt;/p&gt;

Via Broadway
until Union Square, then Fourth Avenue to Bowery/Canal. Chinese coffee
on the subway home. Though this type of exercise is less intense and
more time-consuming than the elliptical machine, it's much more soothing
to my mind. The elliptical machine is so boring that I have to have
something to watch or listen to — my usual choices have been past TV
episodes (without the ads) on Netflix, math lectures, and sometimes
&lt;em&gt;píngshū&lt;/em&gt; 評書. But walking I normally do alone — walking with another
person inevitably brings on conversation, and the meditative benefits of
the long walk are lost. It's less important that I not speak, myself,
than that my mind be completely open to the music of the street. I
always return from these walks feeling rested mentally, my mood
expansive, and my body a little tired but very relaxed.&lt;/p&gt;

The first
exam is 12 days away. I'm deep in the section of the book about which
the instructor said, "This is the longest homework section in the
semester and it will be the majority of the first exam. Those are the
problems to stress about." (I am obedient in all things, sir.) He
recommends ten hours of homework a week for a five-hour-a-week class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started the term, it was taking me an average of 30 minutes per
problem — something I can't imagine the other students are experiencing.
I spent four hours on actual problem-solving today, plus perhaps another
hour or so of flash-card making and other sorts of review. It hardly
seems very much time. But I am pleased to find that my average speed is
now down to 20 minutes/problem. That's cause for optimism, even if it
still feels as though my brain is a corroded mass of old gears. Come to
think of it, I've had that sensation every time I've taken math
recently, but somehow the immediacy of the sensation is replaced by a
feeling of accomplishment after the stress of the moment has passed. It
has been 25 years since I took Calculus II, but I think the gear-box is
getting back to functioning condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, I studied by taking careful notes on the ideas of each
section in the text book, and only doing problems afterwards. But now I
think that's for the birds. Doing problems and groping my way through
the ideas as I need to has proven a more effective way to get
comfortable with the material. The notion that theoretical
understanding, gained from reading the chapter, is a useful guide to
problem-solving, is nonsense here just as it is in every other field I
know of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By far the most common cause of error in my work is sloppy arithmetic
errors — half the time, it is just the result of getting plus and minus
signs wrong. This in spite of considerable effort to avoid such
mistakes. I have had this problem since my childhood. Using LaTeX to do
my problems makes it easier to find them, since I can now actually read
and even search mechanically through what I've written.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Some Western recipe-names as transformed by the Taiwanese linguistic experience</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/some-western-recipe-names-as-transformed-by-the-taiwanese-linguistic-experience.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-02-11T18:47:00-05:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2012-02-11:some-western-recipe-names-as-transformed-by-the-taiwanese-linguistic-experience.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;ul&gt;

targeted in a "class war" by calls to tax them and regulate their
industry, I remember the words of H.L. Mencken (1880–1956):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States is probably the only country ever heard of on earth
in which stockbrokers are almost &lt;em&gt;ipso facto&lt;/em&gt; members of good society.
… In all other societies that I know of they sit below the salt, and
in many countries they are thought of as inferior to ordinary business
men, and the general attitude toward them is that of suspicion. They
are regarded as traders of a peculiarly anti-social type, and that is
precisely what they are. But in the United States they belong to the
best clubs, and their wives and daughters move in very haughty
circles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[This passage presumably dates to before Mencken's 1948 stroke. It
appears in his &lt;em&gt;Minority Report&lt;/em&gt; (1956), a collection of odds and ends
from his private notebooks, as the second paragraph of item #267.
&lt;em&gt;Minority Report&lt;/em&gt; was originally published at New York by Alfred A.

I admire his
ability to defer looking at email at all for what seems to be long
periods — many days — and replying to serious message even less often,
after a considerable length of time. Like me, he has chosen not to
subscribe to a data plan for his mobile phone and has just simple voice
service on it. I believe I can learn to do what he does to avoid the
Emailyama. Of course, when you leave email alone for a while, it
accumulates. Is the Emailyama stronger or weaker then? A puzzle. But it
is better to face him on your own terms and at times of your own
choosing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The period when I have done without email for the longest — I mean, when
I had regular access to email but chose not to use it — was when I was
finishing my dissertation some 15 years ago. I allowed myself 20
minutes, twice a day, for all internet access unconnected to my
research. I didn't really miss it. I also took two hour-long walks every
day, regardless of weather, at that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my fieldwork trips I almost never had email; an American friend
let me use his account occasionally when I was in the same city he was,
but it was a minor part of my life — I spent a lot more time watching
the early-morning slaughtering of pigs (to learn the names of butchering
processes and body parts) and trying to make accurate records of dialect
idioms, improvised dialect songs (&lt;em&gt;shān'gē&lt;/em&gt; 山歌) of very old farm
women, names of local plants and places, and secret language. Email
would have seemed a terrific bore in comparison with those things.&lt;/p&gt;

is a powerful tool for suppressing advertising. After installing
Firefox, you have the choice of installing any number of add-ons, and
this is normally the very first one I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adblock Plus uses filters to determine what is an ad. Finding filters,
unless you write them yourself (a most tedious procedure), requires you
to subscribe to existing lists. I subscribe to eleven in all, and I
almost never see an ad — either graphic or text-based — when I use
Firefox. It makes the Internet a liveable place for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But subscribing to filters is unpleasant because it requires many
repetitive mouse-actions. A faster way is to create a file called
&lt;code&gt;patterns.ini&lt;/code&gt; containing only the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;[Subscription]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(This is my own list, of course.) I save &lt;code&gt;patterns.ini&lt;/code&gt; to the
adblockplus directory, which is typically at a path something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~~~
... Firefox/Profiles/&lt;hash&gt;.default/adblockplus/
~~~~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;hash&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is a random-looking eight-digit alphanumeric sequence
that identifies a given user profile to Firefox. (Each &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;hash&amp;gt;.default&lt;/code&gt;
user profile needs its own set of Adblock Plus filters in the
appropriate subdirectory.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I go to Firefox and open the filter preference window for Adblock
Plus. On OS X, that means &lt;strong&gt;Tools -&gt; Adblock Plus -&gt; Filter
Preferences&lt;/strong&gt;. In the bottom right corner of the window there is a
checkbox marked "Allow some non-intrusive advertising". If I click it,
either to check or uncheck it, the filters in &lt;code&gt;patterns.ini&lt;/code&gt; immediately
repopulate from the URLs I have placed in the minimal file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it doesn't seem to be necessary to go through the tedious manual
installation method in order to get the filter subscriptions. I save a
copy of the minimal &lt;code&gt;patterns.ini&lt;/code&gt; file above in a normal directory for
fast replacement if I need a new user profile for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "Allow some non-intrusive advertising" option was introduced in v. 2
of Adblock Plus — in other words, it is recent. At the moment, only ads
associated with two German sites, &lt;code&gt;netzwelt.de&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;guruads.de&lt;/code&gt;, are
involved, but surely this is the beginning of a much more pervasive
trend, since advertising now funds most internet content, or so it
appears to me. When I was a boy, all television was free as long as you
had a TV set to receive it; apart from public broadcasting, it was paid
for entirely with advertising. So I recognize the smell of this business
model.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Tales from Calculus III</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/tales-from-calculus-iii.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-02-05T13:45:00-05:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2012-02-05:tales-from-calculus-iii.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Twenty-five years after I took Calculus II, I am enrolled in Calculus
III at City College. I've heard from many students that the instructor
is one of the best in the program — he is leading one of ten sections
this semester and I drew him by chance. Below are some observations
recently sent to a few correspondents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The instructor has said firmly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more problems you do, the more shortcuts you will ﬁgure out for
yourself. The only way you can do this is to do a ridiculous number of
problems. You must work almost every day on this stuff, for a couple
of hours a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homework is not graded, but we are supposed to keep a special notebook
in which "assignments", meaning hard problems apart from the homework
proper, are to be done — and those he will examine on occasion. If we've
done them. On Thursday morning we were supposed to visit his office
before class to show him that we do, indeed, possess such a notebook.
The point was to encourage students to make the effort to identify a
notebook for those problems early in the term. I was the only one who
came, though, and I'm going to be using LaTeX, with his blessing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assignment sheet for the semester went up just before class on
Tuesday and he announced it in class and told us to do the first three
sections, 23 problems in all, mostly vectors, which are not well handled
in LaTeX. I spent six hours doing the first assignment and got through
19 of the 23; the last four remain undone several days later, despite my
good intentions. On the day they were official due, several of the
students were still asking him when he would post the problem sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This instructor says he is good at solving problems but his memory is
terrible, so he has never learned LaTeX. Instead, he uses MathType,
which provides a GUI. It's a pity, because a math course is really the
ideal place to introduce LaTeX and guide students in elementary use of
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The instructor made a pitch to interest me in abstract algebra. I must
admit, what he showed me seemed quite interesting and intuitively clear.
I have yet to understand what the place of math will ultimately be in my
life — I only know I am not yet done with this question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am the only student in the class of around 30 who is taking notes on a
computer. Some students do open up a computer briefly, but it seems to
have something to do with messaging. I ran into a little trouble today
with LaTeX because I had anticipated that we was going to introduce
determinants, which I haven't learned how to handle yet (actually it's
not hard, I now see — the amsmath package has everything I'm likely to
need).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A correspondent, seeing the comment about doing "a ridiculous number of
problems," replied:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That sounds reasonable to me. The "problem" is that the advent of
software like Wolfram|Alpha removes any real usefulness from this kind
of skill ... it is now a purely aesthetic amusement.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I disagree. Skill brings understanding, and understanding leads to
insight into other things whose existence you can predict but whose
content and requirements you can't easily anticipate. Much of the
mathematical and theoretical component of the computer science education
at City College consists of exposure to proofs, or to things like proofs
such as building a linked list in C++, and so on. It is not as though we
will ever need to build our own linked lists or derive Chebyshev's
inequality. But struggling to produce them myself helps me to understand
and retain them, and there is considerable value in that.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Jack Cheng on "the technology I grew up with" (2012)</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/jack-cheng-on-the-technology-i-grew-up-with-2012.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-02-05T12:19:00-05:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2012-02-05:jack-cheng-on-the-technology-i-grew-up-with-2012.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://jackcheng.com/"&gt;The developer Jack Cheng&lt;/a&gt; says:&lt;/p&gt;

which it describes this way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This indispensable tool for scholars will become freely available
later this year for non-commercial use. You will be able to download
the font package after agreeing to the End User License Agreement.

&lt;p&gt;The document displaying the font, v. 1.0, is currently posted at
[brill.nl/files/brill.nl/brill_typeface_user_guide_1.00.pdf][].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it happens, Google also supplies fonts — a vast range of them — over
400 as of this morning. They are illustrated at &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts"&gt;google.com/webfonts&lt;/a&gt;
and a showcase of some of them in plausibly familiar applications has
appeared on the website of a &lt;a href="http://hellohappy.org"&gt;designer, Chad Mazzola&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;a href="http://hellohappy.org/beautiful-web-type/"&gt;hellohappy.org/beautiful-web-type/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What most interests me is the different terms of licensing. Brill's
license is proprietary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commercial use of any kind, including the embedding of the fonts or
part(s) of them in any Commercial Product not published by BRILL is
prohibited unless prior written permission has been secured from
BRILL; write to brill-typeface-commercial-license@brill.nl should you
want to acquire such a permission. None of these fonts may be
redistributed to others, nor may they be sold, without prior written
consent from BRILL.

accessed 20120205)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, however, has turned to the generous SIL Open Font License (OFL),
established by the &lt;a href="http://sil.org/sil/"&gt;Summer Institute of Linguistics&lt;/a&gt;, an American
organization of Christian missionary linguists. The OFL is modeled on
familiar "free/libre" licences for other software products, and
specifies at least two points worth reading about thinking about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"the freedom to use font software for any purpose" (dpb: in other
words, use in the commercial products kiboshed by Brill are explicitly
permitted)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We also hope that this new license will fill a need for lesser-known
languages, complex scripts and typographic needs with low direct
economic value and so empower language communities who were left out
by proprietary vendors until now."

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
To say it in a few words, Google offers a library of free fonts,
supported by its immense targeted advertising business. Brill, noted for
its expensive reference works, is operating more like a traditional type
foundry in seeking to control the use of its (single) product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional wisdom, or anyway the opinion of many who are giving their
opinion these days, is that Google's model will soon replace Brill's.
Physical books and DVDs will disappear just as the typewriter did, I am
told. But I'm inclined to think the models will coexist for the long
term, and that proprietary works and tools will continue to survive
among those freely distributed ones whose financial support is less
transparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that technology has enabled the functions of different works and
tools to become much more specialized than they once were, and that is a
prescription for coexistence and coevolution. Think of the variety of
mainstream vehicles that now exist for transmitting a performance: audio
recording, radio, film, television, streaming, podcast — all very
substantial industries that show no sign of disappearing. People still
flock to live performances, too. It's true that the oldest of these
vehicles has not yet been around for 120 years, and in another 120
almost anything might happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To that I say: Google's unrestricted free distribution of tools and
services is supported by a business model that has changed considerably
in the decade and a half since the company was incorporated, and by the
sale of a service that many people feel qualms about even though they
genuinely like the tools and services and are happy not to have to pay
for them. It is hard to be sanguine about the long-term evolutionary
fitness of that model. In particular, I can't see it remaining
completely unrestricted. I predict that Google will gradually impose
more conditions on how users commit themselves to the company and make
their personal information available. I also suspect that governments
will be unable to resist the temptation to tax or regulate those
services. I don't see this game as anywhere near over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no question, however, that Google's model has fulfilled the
traditional function of capitalist innovation, in decimating many
businesses operating on a settled, proprietary model from an earlier
time.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>MoinMoin for notebook-wiki (and WordPress, you are trying the patience of my affections)</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/well-it-doesnt-look-li.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-02-05T00:12:00-05:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2012-02-05:well-it-doesnt-look-li.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;For two days short of a full calendar year I have been keeping a wiki of
my computing notes. A wiki, a lightly organized website structure, is
much better than a nest of files in subdirectories if you are trying to
keep track of what you have learned and accumulate a record of your
experiments and experience. And running it on a server means it is
available to you more or less everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been using MediaWiki, the software that powers Wikipedia. I know
it pretty well, having fiddled with Wikipedia ever since it emerged from
the miasma of unrealized memes. But this year of MediaWiki has been
frustrating. The application is good for mixing markdown with HTML —
markdown is very low maintenance and HTML is helpful when you want fine
control of formatting or to include something from a website — but MW's
brand of markdown sometimes has small problems (for instance, numbering
of an ordered list sometimes resets when a line of "preformatted"
content is interspersed among the numbered items). And a whole MediaWiki
site is not so easy to back up — the simplest thing is to dump the whole
MySQL database, but then that's a large file to deal with every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally this morning I broke down and installed MoinMoin, and
transferred my whole MediaWiki database into it. MoinMoin isn't as good
with HTML as MediaWiki is, but its brand of markdown is simpler than
MediaWiki's. I like the fact that each page is stored as a flat
text-file, meaning that backup with mercurial is very efficient — only
individual diff patch-files are pushed to server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dare say markdown will replace HTML in many environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best of all, MoinMoin looks pretty good in w3m, my text-only browser of
choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
For a while it didn't look as though I would be permitted to post this.
WordPress has drastically redone its software, and I could no longer see
most of what I had written; nor could I preview my text or assign
categories to it. Beside the non-functional text field there was a
little remark: "Blogs are not just for long posts. Why not post a photo
or video instead?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose WordPress over other sites because I liked their software; it
seemed the best tool for what I wanted to do. If I stop liking it, the
whole relationship will be in danger. I don't mean to sound like a
pretty girl with too many suitors, but no company should take my
patronage for granted. I don't need a slick interface — not at all — and
I don't need social media. If that's all you have for me, it's "goombye
pliz".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
(grumble, grumble, a little later)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After posting the abortion of this note as a "quotation" (since
WordPress's parsers determined that there was no content in the original
"text" format), I later became able to edit it in the familiar
interface, with the minimum functionality I require. What a mess. If
your product works, leave it alone, people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Yes, I said text-only browser. W3m, made in Japan, the homeland of
craftsmanship. I am a man of command-line temperament and of words
written and then revised and then revised again. Spare me your sticky
GUI; spare! o spare me your tweets and friending and live webcam feeds,
and let me type what I have to type and have it read by those who have
the patience to read.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>generate native MATLAB code from finished figures, for study</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/generate-native-matlab-code-from-finished-figures-for-study.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-02-03T07:44:00-05:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2012-02-03:generate-native-matlab-code-from-finished-figures-for-study.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are many small irritations in MATLAB, such as the lack of native

Jeffrey J. Hayden around 2002. I no longer have the original file, but
what is here seems basically correct. I may revise it at some time in
the future, though. In the mean time, copies and parallel versions may
be found around the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gwoyeu Romatzyh (also known as GR) is most closely associated with the
name of Y. R. Chao 趙元任, even though it was supposedly the product of
a committee and even though the original inspiration for tonal spelling
seems to have been Lin Yu-tang's 林語堂. There is no question, however,
that in its present form it is largely Chao's work. It is a finely
crafted system of romanization that shows his handiwork and insights in
many places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key idea is that tonal distinctions are represented in the spelling
of words, rather than by diacritics.&lt;/p&gt;

domains hosted on a single server) on Apache2. I had originally bought
separate SSL certificates for each domain, but the certifying authority
swore they could not be used with a single IP address, and rather than
muck with SNI (see
&lt;a href="https://wiki.apache.org/httpd/NameBasedSSLVHostsWithSNI"&gt;https://wiki.apache.org/httpd/NameBasedSSLVHostsWithSNI&lt;/a&gt;) I paid for a
UCC certificate, which allows this arrangement explicitly with a simpler
Apache2 configuration. It seemed to me more important to learn how a
basic Apache2 configuration worked before advancing to more elaborate
topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are my reference notes from the installation. I'll be glad for any
corrections or comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Significance of the name UCC
    ----------------------------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
UCC: Unified Communications Certificate, a single SSL certificate
for multiple domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basics
    ------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After making changes to the various Apache2 configuration files, it
is necessary to restart Apache:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;  &lt;span class="n"&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;etc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;apache2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;restart&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When /etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl is first created, it
is necessary to use&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;  &lt;span class="n"&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a2dissite&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ssl&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;and then&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;  &lt;span class="n"&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a2ensite&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ssl&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;to disable and then re-enable the site; the latter creates a link

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Configuration files
    -------------------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;/etc/apache2/apache2.conf &lt;/strong&gt;: The main configuration file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;/etc/apache2/conf.d/ &lt;/strong&gt;: Contains small configuration files
    for various purposes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/ &lt;/strong&gt;: Contains links to the material
    in /etc/apache2/sites-available&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;/etc/apache2/sites-available/default &lt;/strong&gt;: Contains VirtualHost
    code-blocks for each domain name hosted virtually; each of them
    contains appropriate entries for ServerName, ServerAlias,
    DocumentRoot, CustomLog, ErrorLog; optionally also
    DirectoryIndex and many other specified in the Apache
    documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;/etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl &lt;/strong&gt;: Contains a
    \&amp;lt;VirtualHost _default_&gt; code block prefaced by \&amp;lt;IfModule
    mod_ssl.c&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Errors and Warnings
    -------------------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warn&lt;/strong&gt;: "NameVirtualHost *:80 has no VirtualHosts"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Most of these can be eliminated by removing references to port
80, such as the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;  &lt;span class="n"&gt;NameVirtualHost&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;80&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;that
&lt;a href="http://techexposures.com/2009/06/ubuntu-server-configure-and-run-multiple-websites-on-one-server/"&gt;http://techexposures.com/2009/06/ubuntu-server-configure-and-run-multiple-websites-on-one-server/&lt;/a&gt;
recommends in the apache2.conf file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, one such warning remains. Why? Apparently if any
duplicate "NameVirtualHost" entries exist anywhere in any
configuration files, this error may crop up. I found such a case
in /etc/apache2/ports.conf . At first, I simply changed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;  &lt;span class="n"&gt;NameVirtualHost&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;80&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;  &lt;span class="n"&gt;NameVirtualHost&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
but then the error became "NameVirtualHost *:0 has no
VirtualHosts". So I commented out the whole line and now
everything works correctly (or at least without complaint).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Error&lt;/strong&gt;: "mixing * ports and non-* ports with a
    NameVirtualHost address is not supported, proceeding with
    undefined results"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In /etc/apache2/sites-available/default , if an asterisk * is
used in place of an explicit IP address:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;  &lt;span class="n"&gt;NameVirtualHost&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
but without a specific port being given, then all the other
references to IP addresses in incoming requests as an asterisk
must also omit a port. But if a port is specified, it should be
specified everywhere the asterisk appears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Error&lt;/strong&gt;: "Invalid command 'RewriteEngine', perhaps misspelled
    or defined by a module not included in the server configuration"
    &lt;p&gt;
    Commented out the "RewriteEngine on" block in apache2.conf,
    which writes any incoming port to be 443. Don't know this raises
    an error, but everything apparently works without it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making sure each domain opens its own separate document tree
    ------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In /etc/apache2/sites-available/default , each domain name must
    have its own separate \&amp;lt;VirtualHost&gt; block, containing a
    different DocumentRoot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also, &lt;strong&gt;before&lt;/strong&gt; all the VirtualHost blocks but after the
    NameVirtualHost entry, there should be a ServerName statement
    containing the name of the main domain, for which the UCC
    certificate is configured. (All the other domains can be added
    to or removed from the certificate later, assuming the
    certificate-issuer permits it, but not the main one.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Location of certificates
    ------------------------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certificates should be listed in
    /etc/apache2/sites-available/default within each VirtualHost
    block that they apply to. Along with them,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      SSLEngine on&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
should be listed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certificates themselves are placed in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;  &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;etc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ssl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;certs&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;and I have segregated them within a special folder so that they
are easy to find (below "domain" stands for a whole domain
name):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;  &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;etc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ssl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;certs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;domain_UCC&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In addition, I've labeled each one with a prefix "&lt;code&gt;domain_UCC&lt;/code&gt;"
so that they are easy to identify:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;  &lt;span class="n"&gt;domain_UCC_domain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;crt&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

elliptical machine, which is ghastly boring compared to Gotham Breakneck
outdoors. I can watch a movie or TV show on Netflix, but the kind I
prefer for entertainment — at a thoughtful speed, usually — lose my
interest when I'm exercising. Only dramas filled with action or, better
still, fast-moving deceit and intrigue can hold my attention. And there
are only so many of those that are good enough to watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I've been watching math videos, some of which are really wonderful. I
find they stimulate me to considerable exertion on the machine. The
problem is that they're rarely as long as my 40-60 minute elliptical
sessions. Some are as short as 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using QuickTime Pro, I can combine any number of .m4v files into one and
save the result with no loss of quality. This has completely solved the
problem.&lt;/p&gt;

In
the past this has been my favorite form of exercise, and I think I have
felt healthiest when doing it regularly. Although the number of calories
I burn per hour isn't comparable to what I can do on an elliptical
machine, it is a longer course of exercise than I ever do on a machine
and there is a strong meditative component to it. Above all, the "music
of the city street" succors me like nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got up at 7:45, enough time to leave at 8:00 and be on East Broadway
by 10:30, after a leisurely walk along the river. East Broadway is far
enough east that a little extra time has to be left beyond simply
reaching Canal St. on the West Side. But I looked out the window at the
frozen slush and couldn't motivate myself to go out the door. A proper
morning walk is easiest if you start immediately on rising, without
thinking. I let the moment pass and decided to take the train at 9:30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But at 8:20 I was already feeling regrets. On the principle that
whatever I don't feel like doing is precisely what I should do, I got my
shoes on and was on the road at 8:31. Rather than follow the river, I
took a different route, also slower than necessary, heading to the East
Side through Central Park first. Normally I would follow Broadway, the
most time-efficient path because Broadway cuts gently eastward at a
diagonal through the grid, imposing its humanity on the bureaucratic
structure. I was sure I'd be late. But to my great surprise I arrived at
10:32, essentially in perfect time. I admit I pushed myself to take
longer and faster strides than usual because I didn't want to leave my
food-partner waiting, and so I ran for about three of the blocks. I also
lost my willpower at one moment near the end and hailed a passing #15
bus. But the bus driver ignored me, and I found my own drive fully
refreshed by the slight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Discomforts of the walk to Chinatown from Columbia:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the &lt;strong&gt;Broadway route&lt;/strong&gt; it is stressful facing the "uncity" hordes
    in Times Square. This has gotten worse since the area was closed to
    traffic. I can deal with cars much better than with tourists — in
    the old days, my method was to walk in the street at the edge of the
    traffic, basically a safe and happy between-space for me. But now
    there are no cars and the best idea is to head east around the
    pedestrian-only area. I'm technically a pedestrian, but then again
    not exactly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;river route&lt;/strong&gt; brings you into conflict with bicyclists, while
    all the far West Side routes (10th Avenue and west) put you at the
    mercy of uncity drivers who think they are on a highway rather than
    in New York.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the &lt;strong&gt;East Side&lt;/strong&gt;, on weekends one encounters dog walkers who,
    though not uncity in the formal sense, seem to dwell in a subjective
    suburb all the same, unaware that their long leashes are a dangerous
    obstacle to people like me because their whole attention is on the
    sound in their headphones. On weekdays there are many commuters on
    the street — angrier with the world, it seems to me, on the East
    Side than on the West.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>A local custom without the corresponding exotic saying in rural Taiwan</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/a-local-custom-without-the-corresponding-exotic-saying-in-rural-taiwan.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-01-22T00:43:00-05:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2012-01-22:a-local-custom-without-the-corresponding-exotic-saying-in-rural-taiwan.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I first visited rural Ilan 宜蘭, Taiwan, in the mid 1980s, it was
the East Asian lunar New Year. Ilan people ate soy sauce-stewed
hard-boiled eggs (&lt;em&gt;lớ-nuī&lt;/em&gt; 滷蛋), "gall-treated pork liver" (&lt;em&gt;tám-koaⁿ&lt;/em&gt;
膽肝), a lot of meat dishes, mustard greens in the guise of "longevity
vegetables" (&lt;em&gt;tnĝ-nî-chhài&lt;/em&gt; 長年菜), and the inevitable fish. Inevitable
why? Because there is a Chinese saying, &lt;em&gt;niánnián yǒu yú&lt;/em&gt; 年年有餘 '[may
there be] abundance every year', and "fish" (&lt;em&gt;yú&lt;/em&gt; 魚) is identical in
sound to "abundance". The foreign visitor to a Chinese-speaking
household at New Year's may get to hear this, and its explanation, with
every fish served.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But not in rural Ilan in those days. The local Taiwanese colloquial word
for "fish" is &lt;em&gt;hî-á&lt;/em&gt;, while the character readings are &lt;em&gt;gû&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;gî&lt;/em&gt;;
all are etymologically the same word as Mandarin &lt;em&gt;yú&lt;/em&gt;. "Abundance" is
&lt;em&gt;î&lt;/em&gt; both colloquially and in reading. So "fish" and "abundance" are
definitely not homophones in the local language of Ilan. But the people
there of all ages still ate fish in abundance at New Year's, even though
the saying that explains it was only in use among the younger family
members, educated in Mandarin. The saying is not really local to
traditional Ilan. But eating fish at New Year's certainly is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A happy New Year to all. (Come to think of it, it wasn't usual to say
&lt;em&gt;kiong-hí&lt;/em&gt;, Mandarin &lt;em&gt;gōngxǐ fācái&lt;/em&gt; 恭喜發財 'I wish you happiness and
may wealth descend upon you', then either.)&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>HTTPS being rejected at Yahoo hosting</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/https-being-rejected-at-yahoo-hosting.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-01-18T16:55:00-05:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2012-01-18:https-being-rejected-at-yahoo-hosting.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Someone mentioned that an HTTPS link to a website of mine would not
open, while the same request sent as plain HTTP worked normally. That
would be something quite new — HTTPS requests to my site were working as
recently as last night; I know because I made many of them while writing
a webpage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I looked up some other sites hosted by Yahoo — choosing some that
Yahoo uses to advertise its hosting service (at
http://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/webhosting), sites I could be sure are
indeed currently resident at Yahoo. I confirmed independently that they
are hosted there: &lt;code&gt;whois&lt;/code&gt; lists yahoo.com name servers for all of them.
Among the sites are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;https://chefaimee.com&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;etc. Indeed, all open only with HTTP, not HTTPS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may, of course, be an anomalous outage of some sort; none of the
sites I checked actually supports secure connections for payment. But my
untowardly suspicious mind imagines the problem to be connected to
today's various blackouts in protest against SOPA. The URLs I use to
work on my site, as well as one of Yahoo's secure sites for its own
business (https://order.smallbusiness.yahoo.com/order/choosedomain?),

Landslide is very convenient and (in v. 1.0.1) was easy to install and
operate. I also tried using &lt;a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/"&gt;Pandoc&lt;/a&gt; (v. 1.5.1.1, via apt-get on
Ubuntu 10.04; newer versions have unworkable dependencies) with the
&lt;code&gt;-w slidy&lt;/code&gt; option, but Landslide looks much better, at least with the
default options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two small matters in Landslide v. 1.0.1, which I've reported as issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not all of the functionality is described in the README file; .qr,
    for example, is currently only described in one of the sample files

&lt;li&gt;Although ordinary Chinese text in Unicode displays correctly, high
    codepoints (represented in UTF-8 as surrogate pairs) do not. High
    codepoints are rare, but the failure of software to handle them
    correctly is not.&lt;/li&gt;

it is unclear to what extent it was active even in antiquity. Now,
morphology is a central tool of etymology in those languages that have
it. In its absence, in Chinese, one of the principles of etymology is
that phonologically similar words of similar meaning may be placed
together and called a "word family" (&lt;em&gt;tóngyuán yǔzú&lt;/em&gt; 同源語族). I have
discussed some of the issues surrounding early Chinese morphology and
word families in two papers (Branner 2002, 2003 in the references at the
bottom of this post). Victor Mair has just mentioned this issue in a
criticism of William Rozycki's 1997 essay on "phonosymbolism" and I am
moved to comment here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing Rozycki calls "phonosymbolism" (or sound symbolism) is related
to &lt;em&gt;synesthesia&lt;/em&gt; (stimulation of one kind of sense-impression by
another) and other rhetorical concepts. The key idea that connects all
of them to the Chinese "word family" is that they enable us to reduce
the number of distinct morphemes in the inventory of a language. When I
try to do this — sift down the number of morphemes — in real language
materials, two worries come immediately to mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exclusion&lt;/strong&gt;. English words that seem to belong to Rozycki's "kap"
    group (meaning 'to take' etc. etc. etc.) are easy to think of:
    &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;cop&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;grab&lt;/em&gt;, … . On what principles am I to say that a
    word does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; belong to a certain group? Formally, if we have a
    rule for inclusion, we also need one for exclusion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Systemic order&lt;/strong&gt;. If you go through all the morphemes and corral
    together those that seem to belong to substantial groups, you find
    there are still large numbers that belong to no group. With labor,
    you may be able to create smaller groups — groups of two or three or
    four members — but even then there will be a huge residue of
    morphemes that don't fit comfortably into any group. What is
    accomplished by establishing word families is a reduction in the
    total number of recognized morphemes. The formal question is, after
    we have done that and a huge list of isolated morphemes inevitably
    still remains, just how much have we increased the overall orderly
    state of the system of the language?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A third worry also emerges if you put aside dictionaries and do not try
to work on the inventory of a "whole" standard language, as documented
from multiple sources:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Artificial enrichment from written sources&lt;/strong&gt;. In oral languages
    known to one speaker or a small community of them and documented in
    great detail through linguistic fieldwork, you find that the number
    of semantically redundant morphemes — including exact synonyms as
    well as those connected more imprecisely by phonosymbolic or word
    family relations — drops to almost none. It is not that people do
    not know all those other words, but the inventory or morphemes they
    prefer to use in speech is generally quite restricted. Formally
    speaking, on examination much phonosymbolic and word family
    variation seems to be an artefact of the written documentation of a
    language, whose scope generally exceeds the scope in active use by
    individuals and small communities of speakers. Is it meaningful for
    us to define the scope of a language in terms of our own convenience
    in hunting for cognate forms?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea was developed in Branner 2010 on Chinese secret languages,
documented from original materials collected in fieldwork.
Phonosymbolism through productive morphology, of course, is a separate
matter because it does not affect the number of morphemes in the

satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​1. 拌面 Yellow Noodle with Peanut Sauce. An old standby of Fúzhōu
comfort food, closely related to the "cold noodles in sesame sauce" that
became popular because of Empire Szechwan in the 1970s. Made with flat
noodles, which the sauce keeps from sticking together. The sauce was not
excessively sweet. Quite satisfactory, though this is not the sort of
food to earn high ratings in any case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​2. 豬肚罐 Pig Stomach in Can. There is no can. This is a delicious soup
slow-cooked in a cylindrical porcelain vessel, the same kind used for
decocting medicine. (To keep up with the crush of business they prepare
the soup somewhere else and freeze it, heating up each portion to order
in the store.) The consistency of the tripe (which was clean) was
perfect, and the soup — made with plenty of celery and small black
mushrooms (香菇) — was delectable. Well worth another visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​3. 芋鴨粉乾 Duck &amp;amp; Taro Vermicelli. Noodle soup, made with a stock less
tasty than the "pig stomach in can", above. The noodles are not the
usual ultra-fine "vermicelli" but a white, rice-flour noodle the
thickness and consistency of overcooked spaghetti. Basically
inoffensive, but not "vermicelli". The pieces of duck and taro and black
mushroom were well-cooked and perfectly satisfactory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
This restaurant, formerly So Go Café, has expanded north into the
storefront formerly occupied by Waloy Bakery 華來美食 in 67B East
Broadway. Business is still booming, and they now have a more serious
English menu than when they first opened. The number and arrangement of
seats finally seems adequate to a small restaurant. Clientele remains
overwhelmingly Fúzhōu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soft plastic Western-style spoons rather than the Chinese "boat spoon".
Pay at the cashier when you order and then take a seat; a waitress will
serve you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
They now open at 7:30 AM.&lt;/p&gt;

wastefulness of some of them. (We still receive paper statements because
one of the people in our household prefers them to electronic
statements.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2007, Washington Mutual's statements were still being printed on
heavy US-letter stock, single-sided (the reverse is pre-printed with an
account-reconciliation form and various regulations, in light blue).
There is a lot of blank space on each page — each statement is typically
three pages long, and the content could easily have been presented on a
single side. The postage for three pages would have been the same as for
one at that time (each sheet weighs 0.18 oz and the first ounce is a
single price), but obviously the amount of paper must have made a
difference to the bank's costs. Washington Mutual was seized by the U.S.
Government in the Fall of 2008&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder it there is any correlation between the material expenses of a
bank and its survival in a stressful economy. Probably those costs
approach zero in comparison with employee bonuses, but I wonder if
extravagance in materials is a good predictor of extravagance in other
areas.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Finally making progress with Vim</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/finally-making-progress-with-vim.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-01-05T22:09:00-05:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2012-01-05:finally-making-progress-with-vim.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Now that the semester is over, I am finally in the mood to risk using
the text editor Vim for various tasks that are important to me, and so
to have a chance to learn the thing for real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vim enthusiasts often mention the lack of hand movement as one of the
attractions of this tool. I am not attracted by that, though. I prefer a
certain amount of bodily entropy when studying, and the arm movements of
typing are part of that. And I value the kind of memory that comes from
involving my body in thinking. That is why I use standing desks (various
home-made ones — I'm unwilling to pay the exorbitant prices demanded in
the marketplace). That is why I still use paper books, whose physical
shape serves as a guide to my recollection of what I've read. The
minimal hand- and arm-movements needed for Vim are helpful to
touch-typing, but I don't place great store by them in themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I am really enjoying about Vim today is the need to think, even to
calculate a little before doing anything other than actually typing
text. It reminds me of learning to use a scythe when I was about 14.
Naturally, my inclination was just to slash at the grass. But an adult
watching me, one Pierce Skinner, came over and suggested that I pause
for half a second before each swing of the scythe, to consider what I
was about to do. My scything improved enormously and the act of
fore-thinking felt very good. I am experiencing something similar right
now with Vim and enjoying it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
I see Pierce Skinner is now a practicing clinical psychologist in New
Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Kenneth S.

&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How MilSpecs Live Forever&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US standard railroad gauge (distance between the rails) is 4 ft 8
1/2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in (1.44 m). That's an exceedingly odd number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is that gauge used? Because that's the way they built them in
England,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and the US railroads were built by English ex patriots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did the English build 'em like that? Because the first rail lines
were&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;built by the same people who built the pre-railroad tramways, and
that's&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the gauge they used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did *they* use that gauge then? Because the people who built the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tramways used the same jigs and tools as they used for building
wagons,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which used that wheel spacing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK! Why did the wagons use that wheel spacing? Well, if they tried to
use&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;any other spacing the wagons would break on some of the old, long
distance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;roads, because that's the spacing of the ruts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So who built these old rutted roads? The first long distance roads in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe were built by Imperial Rome for the benefit of their legions.
The&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;roads have been used ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the ruts? The initial ruts, which everyone else had to match for
fear&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;of breaking their wagons, were first made by Roman war chariots. Since
the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;chariots were made by or for Imperial Rome they were all alike in the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;matter of wheel spacing (ruts again).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus we have the answer to the original question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States standard railroad gauge of 4 ft 8 1/2 in derives
from the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;original military specification (MilSpec) for an Imperial Roman army
war&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
chariot. MisSpecs [dpb: sic] (and bureaucracies) live forever!&lt;/p&gt;

Hanke and
Richard Conn Henry have proposed using a single time zone around the
world. They write:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&gt; This would mean that bank employees in the far East of Russia would
&gt; start work with the sun well up in the sky, while bank employees in
&gt; the far west of Russia would be at their desks before the sun has
&gt; risen. But, across the country, they could conduct business with one
&gt; another, all the working day. … One time throughout the world, one
&gt; date throughout the world. Refill dates for prescription drugs would
&gt; be the same day of the month, every month, every year. Business
&gt; meetings, sports schedules and school calendars would be identical
&gt; every year. Today's cacophony of time zones, daylight savings times,
&gt; and calendar fluctuations, year-after-year (sic) would be over. The
&gt; economy — that's all of us — would receive a permanent "harmonization
&gt; dividend." (["Changing Times,"
&gt; http://www.cato.org/pub\_display.php?pub\_id=13940][], accessed
&gt; 20111229)

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when would the working day be? Whose convenience would be served —
who would get to be awake during normal daylight in a unified global
work day?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, China already uses a single time zone (Beijing time, &lt;em&gt;Běijīng
shíjiān&lt;/em&gt; 北京時間) across almost all its own territory, all the way to
the western borders of its Central Asian possessions. Fewer degrees of
longitude are involved than in the case of Russia, but the Chinese
example shows that it is grimly over-optimistic to think we can regulate
people on a turning globe* to live according to a single working day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chinese single time zone is primarily an expression of central
political power over the localities. But there is no question of people
in the non-Han far west actually getting up and going to sleep at the
same times as people in the Han east. People simply will not do that
without coercion. They start work when the daylight is normal for them
to start work, of course. If you want to talk to someone living many
degrees of longitude away, you still have to figure out when they're
awake or at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Harmonization dividends", meaning not having to think about complicated
things, do not come into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For China, where "harmony" (&lt;em&gt;héxié&lt;/em&gt; 和諧) is a current catchword for
obedience to authority, the only "harmonization dividend" from this
system is the lip service paid to the single time zone of the east: a
unified metric appears to be in use, but in reality people just ignore
it when it ceases to be convenient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
* Of course, if the turning globe had one pole permanently toward the
sun, a single time zone would be easy to enforce, and most of the
population would live in the sunlit area. Stay tuned to see if someone

&gt; Perhaps, in our information-besotted age, we know too much. It is
&gt; universally accepted that knowledge of itself brings neither wisdom
&gt; nor understanding. Rules quickly beget formulas — 'traditions'
&gt; likewise — and nothing spells more certain death to a truly living,
&gt; recreative performance. Artur Schnabel once said: 'All the information
&gt; is in the score.' This, rather than any fearful sense of propriety,
&gt; was certainly what governed the approach of the composers of these
&gt; transcriptions. If we too can put aside contentious opinions about
&gt; style and substance, medium and message, we can enjoy a privileged
&gt; glimpse not only of the indestructible majesty of J. S. Bach's music

an effort to document conservative forms of Chinese that would soon
disappear. In the Spring of 2010, I was asked how to pick a location
that would be useful and find a really good illiterate informant. (For
many Western fieldworkers studying unwritten languages, illiterate
speakers are preferred.) Below was my response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for "useful", it depends on what you want to use it for. I went to
the places I did in order to answer a specific set of questions about
issues in classification. But my view is that any location is fine,
provided you have superb informants there and know how to make full
use of them. The informant is always the limiting factor. If I felt
myself free to continue doing fieldwork, I would work with any
appropriate person I could find, regardless of what they spoke. If you
have a good informant, you can get good data, and with good data you
can always find interesting things. So never mind the place — any will
do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have not had the best luck with illiterate people in China.
Basically, I think that literacy is such a central part of Chinese
culture that anyone who has linguistic skills will learn how to read.
It's quite a different matter with some of the minority languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are definite character traits associated with being a good
informant, and having a "verbal personality" is one of them. The
ability to explain the same word consistently on different days, to
enunciate tones clearly and be able to say whether two syllables have
the same tones or not, to explain the functioning of grammar words and
idioms — things like these are what we are interested in, and knowing
Mandarin and how to read does not lessen the informant's ability to do
them. But in my experience, someone Chinese who has these skills and
has nonetheless not learned how to read — well, such people are few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The personality and ability of the informant are the key to
everything. I wouldn't insist on illiteracy.&lt;/p&gt;

to come by during and after World War I in his home, the city of
Przasnysz, Poland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the German troops withdrew, people found elongated bags of brown
flour left behind, and these were hurried off to the local bakers so
that bread could be made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there was something wrong with the flour. The dough was sticky and
didn't rise, and the flour itself was bitter. The bakers didn't know
what to think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually someone turned up who had been to Vienna. "That is not flour
— it is something called &lt;em&gt;Schokolade&lt;/em&gt;. You should try dissolving it with
a little sugar in hot milk."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Przasnysz is pronounced roughly "pras-nish" in English phonology
([pʂas-nɨʂ] in my great uncle's Polish). Its pronunciation in my
grandfather's Russian-fragranced local Yiddish was "prushnyits"; the
city's Yizkor book spells the name "Proshnits". As is common all over
Europe, a given place may have quite different traditional names in
different languages.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Recollection of the traditional bagel in central Poland before World War I</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/recollection-of-the-traditional-bagel-in-central-poland-before-world-war-i.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-12-26T06:34:00-05:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2011-12-26:recollection-of-the-traditional-bagel-in-central-poland-before-world-war-i.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My grandfather Maurice Prager (1902–1992) said that in his boyhood in
the city of Przasnysz, Poland, bagels were only made by private people
for sale on the street, not by bakeries, which dealt in bread, nor by
pastry shops. The food economy in that place and time was different from
our own — far more of it was in the hands of non-professionals (though
my grandfather knew something of the professional food industry because
he was close to his uncle, a miller).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he described them to me, the bagels consisted of thin double strands
of dough braided in a circular spiral, and unlike the almost-holeless
variety we see in New York today they had much more hole than bread. So
far from being chewy or gummy, which define the range of consistency in
New York today, these were extremely tough. They were made of white
flour and did not have any other flavorings, neither seeds nor bulbs,
and forget blueberries or chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My thought is that they must have had more in common with a traditional
German soft pretzel (though boiled before baking rather than treated
with lye) than with either the Montréal or New York bagel.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt; Technology — that child of modern science, which in turn is a child of
&gt; modern metaphysics — is out of humanity's control, has ceased to serve
&gt; us, has enslaved us and compelled us to participate in the preparation
&gt; of our own destruction. And humanity can find no way out: we have no
&gt; idea and no faith, and even less do we have a political conception to
&gt; help us bring things back under human control. We look on helplessly
&gt; as that coldly functioning machine we have created inevitably engulfs
&gt; us, tearing us away from our natural affiliations (for instance, from
&gt; our habitat in the widest sense of that word, including our habitat in
&gt; the biosphere) just as it removes us from the experience of Being and
&gt; casts us into the world of "existences." This situation has already
&gt; been described from many different angles and many individuals and
&gt; social groups have sought, often painfully, to find ways out of it
&gt; (for instance, through oriental thought or by forming communes). The
&gt; only social, or rather political, attempt to do something about it
&gt; that contains the necessary element of universality (responsibility to
&gt; and for the whole) is the desperate and, given the turmoil the world
&gt; is in, fading voice of the ecological movement, and even there the
&gt; attempt is limited to a particular notion of how to use technology to
&gt; oppose the dictatorship of technology.

&lt;p&gt;
&gt; Like ideology, the legal code is an essential instrument of ritual
&gt; communication outside the power structure. It is the legal code that
&gt; gives the exercise of power a form, a framework, a set of rules. It is
&gt; the legal code that enables all components of the system to
&gt; communicate, to put themselves in a good light, to establish their own
&gt; legitimacy. It provides their whole game with its rules and engineers
&gt; with their technology. Can the exercise of post-totalitarian power be
&gt; imagined at all without this universal ritual making it all possible,
&gt; serving as a common language to bind the relevant sectors of the power
&gt; structure together? The more important the position occupied by the
&gt; repressive apparatus in the power structure, the more important that
&gt; it function according to some kind of formal code.
&gt;
&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It is possible to imagine a society with good laws that are fully
respected but in which it is impossible to live. Conversely, one can
imagine life being quite bearable even where the laws are imperfect
and imperfectly applied. The most important thing is always the
quality of that life and whether or not the laws enhance life or
repress it, not merely whether they are upheld or not. (Often strict
observance of the law could have a disastrous impact on human
dignity.) The key to a humane, dignified, rich, and happy life does
not lie either in the constitution or in the Criminal Code. These
merely establish what may or may not be done and, thus, they can make
life easier or more difficult. They limit or permit, they punish,
tolerate, or defend, but they can never give life substance or
meaning. The struggle for what is called "legality" must constantly
keep this legality in perspective against the background of life as it
really is. Without keeping one's eyes open to the real dimensions of
life's beauty and misery, and without a moral relationship to life,
this struggle will sooner or later come to grief on the rocks of some
self-justifying system of scholastics. Without really wanting to, one
would thus become more and more like the observer who comes to
conclusions about our system only on the basis of trial documents and
is satisfied if all the appropriate regulations have been observed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&gt; [Jan] Patočka used to say that the most interesting thing about
&gt; responsibility is that we carry it with us everywhere. That means that
&gt; responsibility is ours, that we must accept it and grasp it here, now,
&gt; in this place in time and space where the Lord has set us down, and
&gt; that we cannot lie our way out of it by moving somewhere else, whether
&gt; it be to an Indian ashram or to a parallel *polis*. If Western young
&gt; people so often discover that retreat to an Indian monastery fails
&gt; them as an individual or group solution, then this is obviously
&gt; because, and only because, it lacks that element of universality,
&gt; since not everyone can retire to an ashram. Christianity is an example
&gt; of an opposite way out: it is a point of departure for me here and now
&gt; — but only because anyone, anywhere, at any time, may avail themselves
&gt; of it.
&gt;
&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the parallel &lt;em&gt;polis&lt;/em&gt; points beyond itself and makes
sense only as an act of deepening one's responsibility to and for the
whole, as a way of discovering the most appropriate locus for this
responsibility, not as an escape from it. (XVIII)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his June 1978 Harvard lecture, [Aleksandr] Solzhenitsyn describes
the illusory nature of freedoms not based on personal responsibility
and the chronic inability of the traditional democracies, as a result,
to oppose violence and totalitarianism. In a democracy, human beings
may enjoy many personal freedoms and securities that are unknown to
us, but in the end they do them no good, for they too are ultimately
victims of the same automatism, and are incapable of defending their
concerns about their own identity or preventing their
superficialization or transcending concerns about their own personal
survival to become proud and responsible members of the &lt;em&gt;polis&lt;/em&gt;,
making a genuine contribution to the creation of its destiny. (XX)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above all, any existential revolution should provide hope of a moral
reconstitution of society, which means a radical renewal of the
relationship of human beings to what I have called the "human order,"
which no political order can replace. A new experience of being, a
renewed rootedness in the universe, a newly grasped sense of higher
responsibility, a new-found inner relationship to other people and to
the human community — these factors clearly indicate the direction in
which we must go. (XXI)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is perhaps clear from even so general an outline, the systemic
consequences of an existential revolution of this type go
significantly beyond the framework of classical parliamentary
democracy. Having introduced the term "post-totalitarian" for the
purposes of this discussion, perhaps I should refer to the notion I
have just outlined — purely for the moment — as the prospects for a
"post-democratic" system. (XXI)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does not this vision of "post-democratic" structures in some ways
remind one of the "dissident" groups or some of the independent
citizens' initiatives as we already know them from our own
surroundings? (XXII)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The real question is whether the brighter future is really always so
distant. What if, on the contrary, it has been here for a long time
already, and only our own blindness and weakness has prevented us from
seeing it around us and within us, and kept us from developing it?
(XXII)&lt;/p&gt;

&gt; To brand someone "a member of the opposition" is tantamount to saying
&gt; he is trying to overthrow the government and put an end to socialism
&gt; (naturally in the pay of the imperialists). There have been times when
&gt; this label led straight to the gallows, and of course this does not
&gt; encourage people to apply the same label to themselves. Moreover, it
&gt; is only a word, and what is actually done is more important than how
&gt; it is labeled. (XII)

&lt;p&gt;A "dissident," we are told in our press, means something like
"renegade" or "backslider." But dissidents do not consider themselves
renegades for the simple reason that they are not primarily denying or
rejecting anything. On the contrary, they have tried to affirm their
own human identity, and if they reject anything at all, then it is
merely what was false and alienating in their lives, that aspect of
living within a lie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that is not the most important thing. The term "dissident"
frequently implies a special profession, as if, along with the more
normal vocations, there were another special one grumbling about the
state of things. In fact, a "dissident" is simply a physicist, a
sociologist, a worker, a poet, individuals who are doing what they
feel they must and, consequently, who find themselves in open conflict
with the regime. This conflict has not come about through any
conscious intention on their part, but simply through the inner logic
of their thinking, behavior, or work (often confronted with external
circumstances more or less beyond their control). They have not, in
other words, consciously decided to be professional malcontents,
rather as one decides to be a tailor or a blacksmith. (XIII)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If "dissidents" have any kind of authority at all, and if they have
not been exterminated long ago like exotic insects that have appeared
where they have no business being, then this is not because the
government holds this exclusive group and their exclusive ideas in
such awe, but because it is perfectly aware of the potential political
power of living within the truth rooted in the hidden sphere, and well
aware too of the kind of world "dissent" grows out of and the world it
addresses: the everyday human world, the world of daily tension
between the aims of life and the aims of the system. (XIII)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is truly a cruel paradox that the more some citizens stand up in
defense of other citizens, the more they are labeled with a word that
in effect separates them from those "other citizens." (XIII)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is hard to say how much worse things would be if there were not
many hard-working people who simply refuse to give up and try
constantly to do the best they can, paying an unavoidable minimum to
living within a lie so that they might give their utmost to the
authentic needs of society. These people assume, correctly, that every
piece of good work is an indirect criticism of bad politics, and that
there are situations where it is worthwhile going this route, even
though it means surrendering one's natural right to make direct
criticisms. (XIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
You do not become a "dissident" just because you decide one day to
take up this most unusual career. You are thrown into it by your
personal sense of responsibility, combined with a complex set of
external circumstances. You are cast out of the existing structures
and placed in a position of conflict with them. It begins as an
attempt to do your work well, and ends with being branded an enemy of
society. (XIV)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&gt; In an era when metaphysical and existential certainties are in a state
&gt; of crisis, when people are being uprooted and alienated and are losing
&gt; their sense of what this world means, … ideology inevitably has a
&gt; certain hypnotic charm. To wandering humankind it offers an
&gt; immediately available home: all one has to do is accept it, and
&gt; suddenly everything becomes clear once more, life takes on new
&gt; meaning, and all mysteries, unanswered questions, anxiety, and
&gt; loneliness vanish. Of course, one pays dearly for this low-rent home:
&gt; the price is abdication of one’ s own reason, conscience, and
&gt; responsibility, for an essential aspect of … ideology is the
&gt; consignment of reason and conscience to a higher authority. (II)
&gt;
&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideology is a specious way of relating to the world. It offers human
beings the illusion of an identity, of dignity, and of morality while
making it easier for them to part with them. As the repository of
something suprapersonal and objective, it enables people to deceive
their conscience and conceal their true position and their inglorious
&lt;em&gt;modus vivendi&lt;/em&gt;, both from the world and from themselves. It is a very
pragmatic but, at the same time, an apparently dignified way of
legitimizing what is above, below, and on either side. It is directed
toward people and toward God. It is a veil behind which human beings
can hide their own fallen existence, their trivialization, and their
adaptation to the status quo. (III)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideology, in creating a bridge of excuses between the system and the
individual, spans the abyss between the aims of the system and the
aims of life. It pretends that the requirements of the system derive
from the requirements of life. It is a world of appearances trying to
pass for reality. (IV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Ideology] is one of the pillars of [the "post-totalitarian"] system's
external stability. This pillar, however, is built on a very unstable
foundation. It is built on lies. It works only as long as people are
willing to live within the lie. (V)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Individuals can be alienated from themselves only because there is
something in them to alienate. The terrain of this violation is their
authentic existence. Living the truth is thus woven directly into the
texture of living a lie. It is the repressed alternative, the
authentic aim to which living a lie is an inauthentic response. Only
against this background does living a lie make any sense: it exists
because of that background. In its excusatory, chimerical rootedness
in the human order, it is a response to nothing other than the human
predisposition to truth. Under the orderly surface of the life of
lies, therefore, there slumbers the hidden sphere of life in its real
aims, of its hidden openness to truth. (VIII)&lt;/p&gt;

the sciences, the Chinese word corresponding to English &lt;em&gt;factorial&lt;/em&gt; is
compositionally transparent — you can tell much more easily what it
means by analyzing it than you can its English counterpart. (At least,
by analyzing it in writing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Factorial&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;jiēchéng&lt;/em&gt; 階乘/阶乘, meaning "stepped multiplication".
Chinese mathematics in symbols usually uses the form &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;! just as other
languages do, but the word is sometimes written out in full, and at
those time it becomes clear that it is being treated a noun. For
instance: &lt;em&gt;ēnde jiēchéng&lt;/em&gt;, written &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; 的階乘, and meaning 'the
factorial of &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;'. In English, &lt;em&gt;factorial&lt;/em&gt; can certainly function as a
noun, but in the form &lt;em&gt;n factorial&lt;/em&gt; (corresponding to &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;!) I think it
is more natural to think of it as a suffixed function-modifier, like
"five squared", "the quotient doubled", and so on. The current version
of the Oxford English Dictionary (accessed on-line, 20111215) does not
list this particular usage, but identifies &lt;em&gt;factorial&lt;/em&gt; first of all as
an adjective, in usage such as &lt;em&gt;factorial expression&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;factorial
function&lt;/em&gt;, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Leibniz's theodicy, dynamic programming, and strategies for learning</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/leibnizs-theodicy-dynamic-programming-and-strategies-for-learning.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-12-14T21:02:00-05:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2011-12-14:leibnizs-theodicy-dynamic-programming-and-strategies-for-learning.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Leibniz, in his &lt;em&gt;Essais de Théodicée&lt;/em&gt; (1710, I), says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Il demeure toujours vrai … qu'il y a une infinité de Mondes possibles,
dont il faut que Dieu ait choisi le meilleur; puisqu'il ne fait rien
sans agir suivant la suprême Raison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[It always remains true ... that there are an infinity of possible
Worlds, from which it must be that God would have chosen the best,
since he does nothing without acting in accordance with supreme
Reason.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leibniz has been roundly ridiculed for this sentiment. Apparently he
rejects the desirability of finding optimal subproblems, in the logical
sense, within moral philosophy. Coming from the coiner of the term
&lt;em&gt;differential&lt;/em&gt; and what remains (300 years on) its modern symbol, this
seems inconsistent. Then again, maybe it is Leibniz's detractors who
fail to see the possibility of optimal subproblems in the order of the
universe, because they are distracted by the immediacy of human
suffering. Perhaps Leibniz thinks that all this really does even out
algorithmically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of efficiency strategies is much on my mind these days, as
I have been trying to master the units on dynamic programming and greedy
algorithms before tomorrow's final exam in Algorithms. There has been
ample time, but somehow I never use time as effectively as I might, and
I wonder if the subject itself does not contain lessons for me, going
forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past year, calendar 2011, I have made headway clearing my desk of
obligations from my past academic life. My mind is clearer, too. Though
not as clear as I wish, since it has been cluttered with the new
learning I have taken in during two semesters of Data Structures and
Algorithms this year, the heart of the mathematical poetry that
underlies computer science. It has been a good year and I think it will
remain a memorable one for me, if perhaps not the best of all possible
years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use the word "cluttered" advisedly above, since it seems to me that
while I am perhaps able to study with preplanned efficiency, my mind
does not learn that way itself. In particular, my mind seems to require
a distinctly inefficient period of "shaking down" what I have learned
before it displays any comfort with new learning, to say nothing of
mastery. A really efficient learning strategy would include provision
for that process.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Emanuel Derman and Paul Wilmott on mathematical models and self-delusion (2009)</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/emanuel-derman-and-paul-wilmott-on-mathematical-models-and-self-delusion-2009.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-12-14T13:10:00-05:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2011-12-14:emanuel-derman-and-paul-wilmott-on-mathematical-models-and-self-delusion-2009.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Derman and Wilmott:&lt;/p&gt;

    are persistently crowded, try riding some number of stops in the
    opposite direction and then switching back to the direction you want
    to go in. You may be able to get on before the crowds have
    accumulated. Schematically, this is like applying a function to a

option for a math guy is to go crazy." Certainly, it seems that math is
more often used as a symbol of deep or contorted thinking than as an
achievable skill or pastime for a normal person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But maybe the situation is not quite so bad. Since 1996, Arnold Reinhold
has been collecting references to math in a website currently at
&lt;a href="http://world.std.com/~reinhold/mathmovies.html"&gt;http://world.std.com/~reinhold/mathmovies.html&lt;/a&gt; . Mathematics seems to
make a few worthy appearances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But hardly as many as there might be. What does this say about
Anglophone society? I have the impression mathematics is taken more
seriously as a pursuit for normal people in South and East Asia, Russia,
and Israel — I wonder if the situation better in movies made in those
places. Or maybe the movie-making world and the world of mathematical
competence are just about mutually exclusive, and so few pathways exist
for improving the portrayal of math in the movies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, I am not bothered so much by depictions of crazy
mathematicians. There have been, after all, some great mathematicians
with spectactularly quirky personalities, if not outright mental illness
— Cantor, Gödel, Boltzmann, and Newton come to mind among the first-rung
names, and there are many others elsewhere in the vast nimbus of minds.
Being strange or mentally ill does not of itself invalidate a person's
thoughts, in any case. (Does that really need to be said?) What bothers
me most is the standard cinematic trope of of the math genius who has
instant insights and doesn't need to work to prove or develop them. You
might call it the Rāmānujan syndrome. Wesley Crusher and Will Hunting
are prime examples. It's hard to think of a stereotype more damaging to
the development of healthy intellectual skills in normal people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something could be done to correct this stereotyping, which I'm sure
takes place because of ignorance rather than ill will on the part of
scriptwriters and directors. How about a movie or two in which
problem-solving is shown as it really is: something carried out by
normal people through patient hard work and practice, through a skill
that can be cultivated by the sane and the normal. After all, solving
problems of one sort or another is something everyone does, and it is
rarely a matter of sudden inspiration — instant, complete, and requiring
no further labor. Then again, maybe someone thinks that isn't dramatic
enough for a movie.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Jim Coplien on reflection and problem-solving (2011)</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/jim-coplien-on-reflection-and-problem-solving-2011.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-12-05T21:58:00-05:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2011-12-05:jim-coplien-on-reflection-and-problem-solving-2011.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Jim Coplien writes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very nature of &lt;em&gt;kaizen&lt;/em&gt; [dpb: 改善] in Japanese culture is rooted
in an introspective state of &lt;em&gt;hansei&lt;/em&gt; [dpb: 反省]: of deep reflection
and of identifying with the problem. Only then are we truly in a
position to understand how we can relate to solving the problem,
either by removing its cause, or working with others to do so, or to
embark on a program of continuous practice to remove the problem. Also
intrinsic to &lt;em&gt;kaizen&lt;/em&gt; is that &lt;strong&gt;improvement comes not so much from
solving the problem, but from going to the next level to remove its
very cause&lt;/strong&gt;. There is lasting value in fixing a software bug. There
is broad, lasting value from improving the process to diminish the
chances that such kinds of bugs can ever arise again. But we need
those bugs, those problems, to trigger the process changes. In that
sense &lt;strong&gt;we celebrate the opportunity that presents itself when a
problem arises, though we soberly assess our place in that system&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Speaking of intentional practice, periodic reflection is a good thing.
Explicitly take time to reflect on opportunities to improve — as an
individual, a family, a team, or as a corporation. It takes trust and
courage, but it builds trust and courage as well. William James said
“The error is needed to set off the truth, much as a dark background
is required for exhibiting the brightness of a picture.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is only one way to learn to understand a serious problem —
whether it is now purely theoretical or a practical problem of
experimentation. And this is to try to solve it, and to fail. … Even
if we persistently fail to solve our problem, we shall have learned a
great deal by having wrestled with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shall never be able to express strongly enough my admiration for the
greatness of mind of these men who conceived this [heliocentric]
hypothesis and held it to be true. In violent opposition to the
evidence of their own senses and by sheer force of intellect, they
preferred what reason told them to that which sense experience plainly
showed them … I repeat, there is no limit to my astonishment when I
reflect how Aristarchus and Copernicus were able to let reason conquer
sense, and in defiance of sense make reason the mistress of their
belief.&lt;/p&gt;

priority queue (&lt;code&gt;Queue.PriorityQueue&lt;/code&gt;), I have succeeded in writing a
little program that can reproduce this error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code is available at &lt;a href="https://bitbucket.org/dpb/queue_change_test"&gt;https://bitbucket.org/dpb/queue_change_test&lt;/a&gt; . It
is intended for Python v. 2.6. As &lt;a href="http://brannerchinese.wordpress.com/2011/11/20/testing-the-reliability-of-the-python-priority-queue/" title="Testing the reliability of the Python priority queue"&gt;I found recently&lt;/a&gt;, the problem does
not normally arise when simple data structures are placed in the queue
and can be sorted in lexicographic order; &lt;a href="http://brannerchinese.wordpress.com/2011/11/28/lack-of-stable-sort-in-pythons-priority-queue/" title="Lack of stable sort in Python’s priority queue"&gt;when stable sort is at issue,
however, the queue sometimes fails&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The error occurs in this code when lists are enqueued and some of their
values are then changed outside of the queue. The queue should
automatically reorder itself, but this does not always happen correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, after the change to the values, the queue is emptied into another
list and those contents then re-enqueued, the new queue is found to be
sorted correctly. That shows that the problem has something to do with
the queue data structure itself and not the values in the queue. The
queue adds values correctly but does not always sort them correctly when
they are changed after being added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pseudo-random numbers in the program use a seed, to allow the error
to be reproduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The user has two options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to enter other seeds (default is none, in which case Python attempts
    to make the results look random by seeding with system time);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to re-enqueue the contents, as described above, in order to
    eliminate sorting errors (default is not to re-enqueue).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The code is commented but as of this writing there is not yet a
documentation file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Update (same night): I have added a second small program,
&lt;code&gt;heapq_change_test.py&lt;/code&gt;, which performs the same test using the &lt;code&gt;heapq&lt;/code&gt;
module. Results are the same. No surprise; Queue relies on &lt;code&gt;heapq&lt;/code&gt;'s
&lt;code&gt;heappush&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;heappop&lt;/code&gt; for its &lt;code&gt;put&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt; methods (see the
&lt;a href="http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/2.7/Lib/Queue.py"&gt;source code at http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/2.7/Lib/Queue.py&lt;/a&gt;).
The results are the same because the same methods are being called.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Literacy book finally out</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/literacy-book-finally-out.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-11-30T00:20:00-05:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2011-11-30:literacy-book-finally-out.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My sixth published volume has finally appeared:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&gt; Professor [Henry M. Sheffer] was really very meticulous; he was in
&gt; charge of my thesis on "Continuity: A Study in Methodology," concerned
&gt; with the question of the difference between a difference of degree and
&gt; difference of kind, and when it's a difference of kind, is it also a
&gt; difference of degree.
&gt;
&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember at the defense of the thesis, at which Professor William
Ernest Hocking was chairman, after they announced that I had passed
the examination, Professor Hocking asked me, "Do you feel that writing
on such a subject has had any effect on your life?" I said, "Certainly
it didn't help me in my habits of indecision."&lt;/p&gt;

documents lines of academic filiation (primarily through doctoral
degrees) in mathematics. It makes for interesting reading. Though my
degree is "Asian Linguistics", I can connect myself to the mainstream
mathematical tree through a sub-branch of four progenitor &lt;em&gt;Doktorväter&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Yuen Ren Chao 趙元任, 1918 (Philosophy)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jerry Norman, 1969 (Oriental Languages)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
[Update 20111213: Chao and Sheffer are now in the tree; see &lt;a href="http://brannerchinese.wordpress.com/2011/12/13/y-r-chao-and-henry-sheffer-added-to-the-mathematics-genealogy-project/" title="Y. R. Chao and Henry Sheffer added to the Mathematics Genealogy Project"&gt;this
post&lt;/a&gt;.] Sheffer and initially Chao studied logic, a field developed at
Harvard by Royce. Sheffer is best known for having introduced the NAND
operation to Boolean logic. Chao's main scholarly contributions were in
Chinese historical phonology and modern grammar. Jerry Norman has
pioneered the rigorous study of Chinese dialect classification, which
you might say is a type of applied logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through Royce, I can trace my "pedigree" to various luminaries of the
Humanist era: Erasmus, Vesalius, Ficino, Copernicus, Leibniz, and Marin
Mersenne, a student of prime numbers after whom is named the Mersenne
twister, a pseudo-random number generator now widely used on personal
computers. To Kant, as well, and to non-Humanists like Thomas à Kempis
and Thomas Cranmer. Most lines peter out in the early 15th century;
earlier stragglers include the mathematician and theologian Heinrich von
Langenstein, an antecedent of Copernicus who received his Theol. Dr. in
1375, while the neo-Platonist Georgios Plethon Gemistos seems to have
received the first of his degrees in 1380.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is romance in seeing one's connection to people like Leibniz and
Erasmus, but it means little beyond that. Does anyone with a PhD today,
in any field, not belong to those lines of filiation? As of today,
Erasmus is shown to have 95301 descendants listed in mathematics alone.
I have learned an enormous amount from Jerry Norman, and it is justice
to call him my &lt;em&gt;Doktorvater&lt;/em&gt;. I find myself in strong agreement with
Chao's model of formal Chinese historical phonology, too, and I have a
special love for logic. But the model of linguistic fieldwork I use owes
considerably more to Robert Austerlitz and Li Fang Kuei 李方桂 than to
Chao, whose approach I consider altogether too literary. I also identify
myself intellectually with my maternal grandfather, who left school when
he was 12 but was a voracious reader and lifelong pursuer of ideas. At
best, all that a paper pedigree can do is remind me to try to be true to
the effort that generations of scholars, known and unknown, have made in
order to seek knowledge and see clearly — to those ideas and those
people all human beings are equally heirs.&lt;/p&gt;

"list" data type, in order to find a rumored source of error in
implementing the Dijkstra shortest-path algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see now that there is an important feature, possible in the list model
but apparently not in the priority queue: stable sorting. I've altered
&lt;a href="https://bitbucket.org/dpb/queue_test"&gt;my queue_test code&lt;/a&gt; to illustrate this difference. I am dealing here
with v. 2.6 of Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a list of lists is sorted under normal conditions, all items of the
sub-lists take part in the sorting: their first item is sorted, then
their second item, then their third, and so on. The result looks like
this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;All these lists begin with 6, but we cannot tell anything about their
original order relative to each other. Those whose second element is 17
all come before those whose second element is 18. Among those beginning
&lt;code&gt;[6, 18]&lt;/code&gt;, those whose third element is 1 all come before those whose
third element is 2. And so forth. The sorting process is carried out on
all elements, leaving no trace of the original order of the lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a stable sort, however, only some specified item is sorted, and the
other items are not examined, so a remnant of the earlier order persists
in the sorted result. The result might look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You can see that &lt;code&gt;[6, 17, 18, 16]&lt;/code&gt; "ought" to be placed after
&lt;code&gt;[6, 9, 20, 4]&lt;/code&gt;, and so forth, but stable sorting has left them out of
order, reflecting their original relative position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stable sort in Python 2.6 is achieved by use of a key as an argument of
the &lt;code&gt;sort()&lt;/code&gt; method, and can be refined by use of the &lt;code&gt;itemgetter()&lt;/code&gt;
method of the &lt;code&gt;operator&lt;/code&gt; module. But Python's priority queue does not
seem able to sort by a key or to sort stably. For an illustration, see
the current version of my &lt;code&gt;queue_test&lt;/code&gt; code, online at
&lt;a href="https://bitbucket.org/dpb/queue_test"&gt;https://bitbucket.org/dpb/queue_test&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

pot, it is a deep yellow color. But when turmeric is cooked at low heat
in a stainless steel pot, it is noticeably more reddish and darker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that the reddening of turmeric is the result of interaction with
alkaline substances — in fact, it used to be used in making a kind of
paper used for testing high pH values, and you can observe that a little
baking soda reddens fresh turmeric before your eyes. It seems that the
steel is producing a similar change. I've switched to a pot with a
non-stick coating, and the tea is now the same color as that produced by
infusion in ceramic.&lt;/p&gt;

When cooled rather than infused, fresh turmeric tea clouds as it cools,
but heating it restores its clarity. The second and third pots from the

to the sweet, carrot-like taste of the first pot. Both pots have a

describes conclusions from the past several decades about
neuro-plasticity — the ability of the brain to reorganize itself and
improve its functioning and efficiency. The main researcher whose
research is highlighted is the psychologist Donald O. Hebb (1904–85),
and there is also material about the rehabilitation clinic of Dr. Edward
Taub. The documentary consists in large part of interview snippets with
the neuroscientists William Jagust, Arthur Toga, Michael Merzenich,
Jason Karlawish, and the authors Sharon Begley, Shannon Moffett, and
Norman Doige, interspersed with animations and other illustrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documentary is suitable for general viewers although it seems to be
directed especially at older people concerned about avoiding cognitive
impairment. To speak harshly, I found it motivational at the expense of
concrete documentation. But it was interesting and there were two
summary lists at the end that were relatively useful:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Tenets"&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time 44:03&lt;/em&gt;. "Change can occur only when the brain is in the mood."
    Paying attention and being alert and ready for action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;45:03&lt;/em&gt;. "Change strengthens connection between neurons engaged at
    the same time." Trying something repeatedly allows the brain to
    selectively remember the most effective combinations of small
    variables contributing to the more effective tries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;46:02&lt;/em&gt;. "Neurons that fire together wire together." Much of the
    brain's functioning involves prediction, and the brain improves its
    ability to predict based on observation of things that reliably
    occur in series.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;47:45&lt;/em&gt;. "Initial changes are just temporary." The possibility of
    changing the brain's structure increases when activities are
    repeated over time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;48:41&lt;/em&gt;. "Brain plasticity is a two-way street and we can either
    drive brain change positively or negatively." Malleability can mean
    vulnerability, as well as the flexibility to change. Persistent bad
    habits and environmental interference are examples of negative
    effects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;49:52&lt;/em&gt;. "Memory is crucial for learning." The brain maintains a
    model in memory of what it is trying to do and evaluates the results
    of repeated attempts to meet that model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;50:54&lt;/em&gt;. "Motivation is a key factor in brain plasticity."
    Acquisition of new skills is the primary means for developing the
    adult brain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;"Tips for optimal plasticity"&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;55:30&lt;/em&gt;. "You need your heart to be decent shape."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;55:40&lt;/em&gt;. "Training should be incremental."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;55:45&lt;/em&gt;. "Training needs to be taxing and systematically improving."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;55:57&lt;/em&gt;. "It should be interesting to engage the motivation circuits
    in your brain."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

current activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My study of and research on Chinese involves a kind of technical
thinking about abstract linguistic categories, but those categories and
the evidence for them require doing long stretches of basically
mechanical, clerical work — collation of field notes or minute
philological details — the aptitude for which the people at the Johnson
O'Connor foundation call "graphoria". In this work one does relatively
little interesting original thinking, except to the extent that one is
aware of the higher-level problems to which the mechanical work and the
minute details will contribute. And there is also something meditative
and satisfying about paying close attention to minute details for a long
stretch of time, so the work by no means simply mindless rote action.
Working with Chinese words, spoken and written, in particular, seems to
stir my musical and graphic-analytical proclivities, and I have the
sensation that Chinese grammar moves a kind of structural thinking, as
well. So the mechanical work is not without its interest and
satisfactions, though those do not compare to the kind of thinking one
can eventually do when one has the necessary data assembled for actually
attacking a problem in a unified way. I often think that one of the
things that makes formal linguistics so uninteresting is that its
practitioners seem to spend a lot of time avoiding actually handling
data at length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In programming and mathematics, however, neither the graphoria nor any
aspect of language or music aptitudes seem to be directly helpful. In
fact, I often find that my motivation to turn my mind to non-linguistic
quantitative thinking is hindered by whatever time I have recently spent
on mechanical or linguistic work, because those are inevitably easier to
pick up quickly than math or a complex programming task. I experience a
wrenching "code-switching" moment when I have to do this. I have still
to find a good way to get my mind into the mood for math quickly if I
have been doing those "lower"-level tasks. The only effective way I have
found so far is to put clerical tasks completely away from myself for
weeks at a time, but in real life it is not possible to do that, and
certainly not for the coming half year, until my last two or three book
projects are done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get a little help from using a timer to force myself to to spend some
period of time working concentratedly on one type of task before
switching to another. But the code-switching remains jarring even with
the pressure of the timer to aid the switch. I wonder daily if
overcoming code-switching is after all simply a matter of patience and
concentration.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Wishes for the Orthodox Nativity Season (began 15 November this year)</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/wishes-for-the-orthodox-nativity-season-began-15-november-this-year.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-11-25T07:04:00-05:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2011-11-25:wishes-for-the-orthodox-nativity-season-began-15-november-this-year.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As there are different seasons of a man's life, so there are different

yā&lt;/em&gt; 琵琶鴨 'lute-shaped duck'. The duck is cut open and roasted while
splayed flat with a horseshoe-shaped metal frame. The splaying allows
more moisture to evaporate and fat to drip out during roasting, so the
meat is drier and the flavor more concentrated. Ordinary &lt;em&gt;shāoyā&lt;/em&gt; 燒鴨
'roast duck' has a quantity of dark liquid inside that is discarded when
the duck is cut into pieces (&lt;em&gt;zhǎn&lt;/em&gt; 斬), but the &lt;em&gt;pípá yā&lt;/em&gt; does not, and
that accounts for part of the difference. The roasting process itself is
the same as for ordinary &lt;em&gt;shāoyā&lt;/em&gt;; there are no other seasonings used,
for instance. The metal frame remains in place until the duck is cut up.
All the Cantonese roast fowl have skin that is basically soft, unlike
the more familiar Peking duck, which is specially treated to burn off
the fat and leave the skin crisp (or leathery, depending on your chef's
skill).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name &lt;em&gt;pípá yā&lt;/em&gt; has to do with the fact that the splayed-open duck is
imagined to look like a Chinese lute — &lt;em&gt;pípá&lt;/em&gt; 琵琶 (Japanese &lt;em&gt;biwa&lt;/em&gt;,
Korean &lt;em&gt;bipa&lt;/em&gt;) — which has a round body. The duck's neck is usually
curved to one side, unlike the straight neck of an ordinary roast duck.
As with many Chinese culinary metaphors, 'lute' is not so apt as it is
appetizing — I mean, in its suggestion of palace life or scholarly
seclusion. When I was a boy, my friends and I called these things
"frisbee ducks", which has no charm at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought one this morning from Sun Sai Gai 新世界 at 220 Canal, corner
Baxter, one of Chinatown's long-term institutions (though the management
has changed a number of times in the 35 years I've been going there).&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Testing the reliability of the Python priority queue</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/testing-the-reliability-of-the-python-priority-queue.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-11-20T19:58:00-05:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2011-11-20:testing-the-reliability-of-the-python-priority-queue.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hearing of a problem with the PriorityQueue class in Python's &lt;code&gt;Queue&lt;/code&gt;
module, I wrote &lt;a href="https://bitbucket.org/dpb/queue_test/src"&gt;this short program to test the class&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Python priority queue is modeled here by a list, which is sorted so
as to match the queue's ascending order. The queue data structure
differs from a list in having its size fixed at creation time, making
possible a &lt;code&gt;full()&lt;/code&gt; method, which lists do not have. Queues also differ
from lists in that they can be blocked or have a timeout value applied
to their methods, since they are intended for use with threads.
Otherwise, lists have a much larger inventory of functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the this program, the two objects created are filled with random
numbers, using both &lt;code&gt;put()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;get()&lt;/code&gt; so that the queue contracts as
well as expands, and then subjected to four tests:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The queue should be full (meaning that &lt;code&gt;full()&lt;/code&gt; returns True) after
    being created and populated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sizes of the objects are compared (using &lt;code&gt;qsize()&lt;/code&gt; for the queue
    and &lt;code&gt;len()&lt;/code&gt; for the list).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The objects are compared item by item (using &lt;code&gt;get()&lt;/code&gt; for the queue
    and indexing for the list).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After all the values in the queue have been dequeued, it should in
    fact be empty, meaning that &lt;code&gt;empty()&lt;/code&gt; returns True.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This test is repeated in an endless loop which can be terminated with
&lt;code&gt;^C&lt;/code&gt;, after which the program reports the number of item-comparisons and
errors found. Failure of either tests 1 or 4, however, will terminate
the loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The user is offered the chance to supply the size of the queue and list,
as well as the upper value of the range of random numbers (the lower
value is 1). Default values are 10000 for both variables if the user
does not enter values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that blocking and timeout is not tested here. The &lt;code&gt;put_nowait()&lt;/code&gt;
and &lt;code&gt;get_nowait()&lt;/code&gt; methods were tested manually but then removed from
the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;: No problems have been found in &lt;code&gt;Queue.PriorityQueue&lt;/code&gt; as of
this writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;, 20111130: I've more recently discussed a more interesting conclusion about this problem: see &lt;a href="lack-of-stable-sort-in-pythons-priority-queue.html"&gt;Lack of Stable Sort in Python's Priority Queue&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="apparent-error-in-pythons-priority-queue.html"&gt;Apparent Error in Python's Priority Queue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

talks about the importance of articulateness in natural language:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an enormous difference between one who is monolingual and
someone who at least knows a second language well, because it makes
you much more conscious about the phenomenon of language structure in
general. You will discover that certain constructions in one language
you just can’t translate. I was once asked what were the most vital
assets of a competent programmer, and I said, at the time, a
mathematical inclination and an exceptional mastery of his native
tongue. I said “mathematical inclination” because at the time it was
not clear how mathematics as understood at that moment could
contribute to a programming challenge. And I said “native tongue” and
not “English” because, well for lack of formalism, you have to think
in terms of words and sentences using a language you are familiar
with. Moreover, but I didn’t know that at the time, research has shown
that when people acquire a second language, they never get a greater
mastery of it than they have of their own language, their native
tongue: that clearly sets the standard for how articulate you are
going to be.&lt;/p&gt;

remembers the circumstances of the discovery of his shortest path
algorithm:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One morning I was shopping in Amsterdam with my young fiancée, and
tired, we sat down on the café terrace to drink a cup of coffee and I
was just thinking about whether I could do this, and I then designed
the algorithm for the shortest path. As I said, it was a twenty-minute
invention. In fact, it was published in ’59, three years late. The
publication is still readable, it is, in fact, quite nice. One of the
reasons that it is so nice was that I designed it without pencil and
paper. I learned later that one of the advantages of designing without
pencil and paper is that you are almost forced to avoid all avoidable
complexities. Eventually that algorithm became, to my great amazement,
one of the cornerstones of my fame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was originally published in 1959 in a German article in &lt;em&gt;Numerische
Mathematik&lt;/em&gt;. F.L. Bauer had founded that journal and he was soliciting
for articles. Now, at the time, something like an algorithm for the
shortest path, that was hardly considered mathematics: there was a
finite number of ways of going from A to B and obviously there is a
shortest one, so what’s all the fuss about? So that is why it remained
unpublished, but when Bauer asked whether we could contribute
something, I said, yes, I could, because in the mean time I had also
designed the shortest subspanning tree. I had done that for my
hardware friends. You know, on the big panel you have to connect a
whole lot of points with the same copper wire because they have to
have the same voltage. How do you minimize the amount of copper wire
that connects these points? So I wrote an article “A note on two
problems in connection with graphs” or something like that. But now,
when I went to my ophthalmologist — and to the best of my knowledge he
did not even know that I was a computing scientist — he said, ‘Have
you designed the algorithm for GPS?” It turned out he had seen the
Scientific American of last November [2000].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Riverside Church, performed by Russian Chamber Chorus of New York and
the Riverside Choir under Nikolai Kachanov. In several of the six
movements I found the melodies hard to relate to the Latin text, but the
Sanctus and especially the Agnus Dei were utterly majestic. It was a
memorable conception and performance, and I hope this substantial piece
gets more and wider hearings. It is a little disturbing to see the
wealth of music Podgaits has composed (his biography is currently at
&lt;a href="http://podgaits.info/spisoksochineny_.htm"&gt;http://podgaits.info/spisoksochineny_.htm&lt;/a&gt; on his own site) and then
realize that the English-language Wikipedia subsite has no entry for him
at all; the Russian-language subsite also seems to lack one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kachanov and his Chorus have been performing Russian choral music,
secular and sacred and of all periods, for over a quarter century.
Recently he has concentrated on music of the past century, little of
which is heard in performance by other groups in New York. I have never
been disappointed at their concerts; the calendar is maintained at

nutrient widely used by athletes to build muscle mass. I have no
interest in muscle mass, but was interested in reports of improvements
to cognition and memory in certain circumstances — something that has
begun to interest me keenly as I try to manage my time and shepherd my
attention in order to learn mathematics as well as I can. I have
achieved pretty dense technical expertise in Chinese and related areas,
but math is harder for me than anything else I have ever studied. On the
other hand, creatine's effects on cognition and memory are documented
mainly for people with impaired cognitive ability due to age, illness,
diet, or exhaustion. Only the last of these might conceivably apply to
me in my present life, and I am not aware of any cognitive deficit — in
fact, I seem to get a lot more done than most people I know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Creatine&lt;/strong&gt;. Creatine is synthesized in the human body from amino acids
and can be fully absorbed for at least the first several months of use,
after which its effects seem to drop off. There seem to be no known
dangers to its use in my circumstances. The creatine I took was from
Twinlabs, which says that it buys the raw ingredient from laboratories
in Germany and China, and tests and packages it in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dosage&lt;/strong&gt;. For ten days, I took 3.6 g of creatine monohydrate twice a
day, together with vitamin B and C and some simple carbohydrates. These
doses are typical of those in medical experiments and are at the low end
of what is apparently common in use by athletes, for whom doses of
20-30g/day are not unusual. For the following four days I took no
creatine at all but continued the vitamin B and C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effects&lt;/strong&gt;. I noticed a very marked increase in the energy I felt,
especially when exercising — when walking fast on New York streets (the
so-called Gotham Breakneck) and on an elliptical machine. I would
describe my mood as somewhat more excited than usual, but not to the
point of being jumpy or jittery. When walking, I felt quite a surge of
power — so much that at first I thought I ought to be careful lest I
inadvertently bump into someone. For the elliptical machine, I can offer
an actual measurement, since the machine I use measures the energy
needed to resist the flywheel's rotation and reports that as a number of
calories. During the ten days of creatine use, I averaged 940
calories/hour of exercise. In the previous eight weeks, without any
creatine use, I averaged 902 calories/hour. The increase was about 4%
over my recent level — nothing spectacular, even if significant. Over
the past two years I have averaged 924±70 calories/hour on the same
machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anecdotally, I noticed some increase in libido and food-cravings (though
not overall appetite). Both may be attributable to the feeling of
excitement I described above. Apart from that sensation, I noticed no
changes in my overall range of moods. My sleep was noticeably sounder
than usual. In my normal life without creatine, unless I have had a
minimum of 80 minutes of strenuous exercise during the previous day, I
typically wake up at night after 3-4 hours and have to force myself to
sleep again, often by reading or writing. I think this is the effect of
stress, which exercise relieves very palpably. During the period of
creatine use I slept at least 6 and half hours every night and do not
recall waking after 3-4 hours, even though I got the same amount of
strenuous exercise I normally do — which is to say about 45 minutes a
day, plus the modest effects of working at a standing desk for most of
my work day and a small amount (30 minutes or less) of Gotham Breakneck
walking. I typically take at least one short (10-20 minute) nap during
the day, and also did so on the days when I was taking creatine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been reports of dyspepsia or water retention with creatine
use in controlled conditions, but I noticed none. All my bodily and
mental functions appeared normal to me, except for the few items
described above: mild but persistent excitement, considerable power when
exercising, more energy during the day, mildly increased libido and
food-cravings, sounder sleep without waking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, I noticed no improvement in my ability to get through
hard intellectual problems, to prioritize tasks, to recall facts, or to
concentrate generally. In fact, since each dose of creatine was followed
by several hours of comparative excitement, I think the state of my mind
for study was slightly less than ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After ending the use of creatine, I felt completely normal beginning on
the very first day — my levels of energy and attention seemed normal to
me. My ability to concentrate on difficult ideas was no worse than when
I was taking creatine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, that &lt;strong&gt;creatine seems to be effective for increasing one's energy
level&lt;/strong&gt;, especially for physical exercise. If I find myself tired or
under heavy stress, I may take small doses again for a limited period of
time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, that &lt;strong&gt;creatine is of no use to me as a study aid&lt;/strong&gt;. I had
considered that patience and concentration are matters of
time-management, which is a matter of discipline, which can be thought
of as a matter of strength and stamina — and that creatine would help
with the first step in this chain, that of strength and stamina. But I
now see very much more clearly that patience is a consequence of the
reflexive application of patience itself, and that the increase in
physical energy brought about by creatine is actually a hindrance (say,
a small one) to the cultivation and practice of patience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Readings&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are interesting extracts from the abstracts of about two dozen
articles I examined while researching creatine. They should not be read
out of context; the best thing would be to look up the original articles
and read the abstracts completely and then try to understand as much of
the original articles as one can in a reasonable amount of time. I spent
a number of hours reading the materials and taking the notes below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognition and Memory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Following 24-h sleep deprivation, creatine supplementation had a
    positive effect on mood state and tasks that place a heavy stress on
    the prefrontal cortex. McMorris et al., 2006a.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creatine supplementation aids cognition in the elderly. McMorris et
    al., 2007a.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creatine supplementation only improves cognitive processing and
    psychomotor performance in individuals who have impaired cognitive
    processing abilities. Rawson et al., 2008.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creatine seems to be totally absorbed since no creatine or
    creatinine was detectable in feces. Ingestion of creatine combined
    with BG facilitates its retention by slowing down its absorption
    rate and reducing its urinary excretion. Deldicque et al., 2008.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During sleep deprivation with moderate-intensity exercise, creatine
    supplementation only affects performance of complex central
    executive tasks. McMorris et al., 2007b.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In vegetarians rather than in those who consume meat, creatine
    supplementation resulted in better memory. Irrespective of dietary
    style, the supplementation of creatine decreased the variability in
    the responses to a choice reaction-time task. Benton et al., 2011&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The median healthy life span of Cr-fed mice was 9% higher than in
    control mice, and they performed significantly better in
    neurobehavioral tests. In brains of Cr-treated mice, there was a
    trend towards a reduction of reactive oxygen species and
    significantly lower accumulation of the "aging pigment" lipofuscin.
    Bender et al., 2008.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After taking the creatine supplement, task-evoked increase of
    cerebral oxygenated hemoglobin in the brains of subjects measured by
    near infrared spectroscopy was significantly reduced, which is
    compatible with increased oxygen utilization in the brain. Watanabe
    et al., 2002.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Habituation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recent findings in healthy humans indicate that the beneficial
    effect on muscle function and muscle total creatine content may
    disappear when creatine is continuously ingested for more than two
    or three months. The mechanism for this habituation to chronic
    creatine exposure is poorly understood. (Derave et al. 2003) [DPB:
    Full text was not available.]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Withdrawal from Cr had no effect on the rate of strength, endurance,
    and loss of lean tissue mass with 12 weeks of reduced-volume
    training. (Candow et al., 2004). [DPB: in other words, after
    cesssation of creatine, its lingering effect on strength, endurance,
    and loss of lean tissue mass is indistinguishable from not having
    taken it at all.]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Safety&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We advise that high-dose (&gt;3-5 g/day) creatine supplementation
    should not be used by individuals with pre-existing renal disease or
    those with a potential risk for renal dysfunction (diabetes,
    hypertension, reduced glomerular filtration rate). A
    pre-supplementation investigation of kidney function might be
    considered for reasons of safety, but in normal healthy subjects
    appears unnecessary. Kim et al., 2011.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is little to no evidence that any of the newer forms of
    creatine are more effective and/or safer than CM whether ingested
    alone and/or in combination with other nutrients. Jäger et al.,
    2011.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short-term Cr supplementation appears to be safe but does not
    enhance push-up performance. Armentano et al., 2007.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To date, studies have not found clinically significant deviations
    from normal values in renal, hepatic, cardiac or muscle function.
    Few data are available on the long-term consequences of creatine
    supplementation. Perskey et al., 2007.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Under conditions that exist the human stomach (high acidity and
    supply of nitrite from food and saliva), creatine can react to form
    N-nitrososarcosine that is known to induce esophageal cancer in rats
    and stomach cancer in mice. Archer, 2004.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Main side effects were gastrointestinal complaints. Although serum
    creatinine levels increased in Cr patients because of the
    degradation of Cr, all other markers of tubular or glomerular renal
    function, especially cystatin C, remained normal, indicating
    unaltered kidney function. Bender et al., 2008.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While creatine may enhance the performance of high-intensity,
    short-duration exercise, it is not useful in endurance sports.
    Because commercially marketed creatine products do not meet the same
    quality control standards of pharmaceuticals, there is always a
    concern of impurities or doses higher or lower than those on the
    labeling. Graham et al., 1999.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Caffeine and Creatine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High combined doses of creatine and caffeine does not affect the LBM
    composition of either sedentary or exercised rats, however, caffeine
    supplementation alone reduces the percentage of fat. Vertical
    jumping training increases the percentages of water and protein and
    reduces the fat percentage in rats. Franco et al., 2011.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Caffeine ingestion after creatine supplements augmented intermittent
    high-intensity sprint performance. Lee et al. 2011.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although caffeine and creatine appear to be ergogenic aids, they do
    so in a sport-specific context and there is no rationale for their
    simultaneous use in sport. Higher doses of caffeine can be toxic and
    appear to be ergolytic. There is no rationale for creatine doses in
    excess of the recommendations, and some athletes can get stomach
    upset, especially at higher creatine doses. Tarnopolsky, 2011.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These findings suggest that the acute ingestion of this preexercise
    supplement ["containing caffeine, creatine, and amino acids"] may be
    an effective strategy for improving anaerobic performance, but
    appears to have no effect on aerobic power. Fukuda et al., 2010.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improvements in VO2max, [critical velocity], and [lean body mass]
    when GT ["proprietary blend including whey protein, cordyceps
    sinensis, creatine, citrulline, ginseng, and caffeine"] is combined
    with HIIT ["high-intensity interval training"]. Three weeks of HIIT
    alone also augmented anaerobic running performance, VO2max and body
    composition. Smith, et al, 2010.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As indicated by a greater T(lim), acute caffeine ingestion was found
    to be ergogenic [New Oxford American Dictionary, version bundled
    with Mac OS 10.5.8: "intended to enhance physical performance,
    stamina, or recovery"] after 6-d of creatine supplementation and
    caffeine abstinence. Doherty et al., 2002.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is concluded that Caf intake (3 days) prolongs muscle RT
    [relaxation time] and by this action overrides the shortening of RT
    due to creatine supplementation. Hespel et al., 2003.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Caffeine pharmacokinetics were not affected by concomitant
    administration of creatine or by physical exercise. In conclusion,
    neither maximal performance and subsequent recovery nor aerobic
    performance were enhanced by oral creatine supplementation in the
    study. Vanakosky, et al., 1998.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The data show that Cr supplementation elevates muscle PCr
    concentration and markedly improves performance during intense
    intermittent exercise. This ergogenic effect, however, is completely
    eliminated by caffeine intake. Vandenberghe et al., 1996.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

information in my Notes collection — see &lt;a href="https://github.com/brannerchinese/notes/blob/master/CONTENT/LaTeX/Graphing_flowcharts_and_automata.md"&gt;the current note&lt;/a&gt; or visit
&lt;a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/brannerchinese/notes/blob/master/searchPage.html"&gt;the search page for the Notes collection&lt;/a&gt; and search for "graph or
"automaton", etc.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The language &lt;a href="http://www.graphviz.org/content/dot-language"&gt;Dot describes graphs in plain text&lt;/a&gt;. It is used with the
&lt;a href="http://graphviz.org"&gt;Graphviz&lt;/a&gt; graphic application; both were originally developed at Bell
Labs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are a few notes on surprises I had when working with &lt;code&gt;.dot&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;.svg&lt;/code&gt; ("Scalable Vector Graphics", a standard XML-based format for
graphs) files in Python:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For viewing &lt;code&gt;.svg&lt;/code&gt; files, desktop installations of Ubuntu use the
    Gnome viewer "Eye of GNOME" (&lt;code&gt;eog&lt;/code&gt;) by default.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ubuntu's (Lucid) server installation of graphviz does not include a
    viewer by default. You can display &lt;code&gt;.svg&lt;/code&gt; files using Firefox; set
    the browser to &lt;code&gt;about:config&lt;/code&gt; and confirm that you have the setting
    &lt;code&gt;svg.smil.enabled;true&lt;/code&gt; and place an entry in your &lt;code&gt;~/.mailcap&lt;/code&gt;
    file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;image/svg+xml; firefox&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Of course, you can also install &lt;code&gt;eog&lt;/code&gt; on your server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current Mac version of Graphviz (v. 2.28) has no trouble opening
    a &lt;code&gt;.dot&lt;/code&gt; file, but apparently it cannot open &lt;code&gt;.svg&lt;/code&gt; files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For use within LaTeX documents, it is possible to do everything native
packages or (more interestingly) to incorporate Graphviz output by
converting it to a native format:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The native LaTeX tools for producing flowcharts and automata are the
    &lt;code&gt;tikz&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;pstricks&lt;/code&gt; packages. TikZ, which has more comprehensive
    support, supplies a library called &lt;code&gt;automata&lt;/code&gt; (see the TikZ manual
    for detailed instructions. There is also a third library,
    [&lt;code&gt;VauCanSon-G&lt;/code&gt;][], but it appears to have less functionality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a Python module, &lt;code&gt;dot2tex&lt;/code&gt; by &lt;a href="http://www.fauskes.net/code/dot2tex/documentation/"&gt;Kjell Magne Fauske&lt;/a&gt;, that
    converts &lt;code&gt;.dot&lt;/code&gt; and other Graphviz formats to TikZ or pstricks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fauske has also written a [LaTeX package, &lt;code&gt;dot2texi&lt;/code&gt;][], that allows
    &lt;code&gt;.dot&lt;/code&gt; (etc.) graphical output to be embedded directly in a LaTeX
    document.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of them is improving a piece of my own prose. After laboring to
bring ideas into being as words and then to cantilever those words
themselves until everything balances like a Calder mobile, I may raise
my head - feeling that a very long time has passed - to find that not
even an hour has gone by on the clock. There follows the relief of
realizing that less time has elapsed in the material world than in my
experience of it — relief since so often it is the other way around, and
when it is the other way around I feel a little cheated and frustrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another case is the enlivening of words by music. Sometimes the result
is what known as "opera time", in which the events of a musical drama
are out of step with the tempo of the same events in real life. I
mentioned this effect in passing in recent posts about &lt;a href="http://brannerchinese.wordpress.com/2011/11/11/two-of-elviras-arias-from-don-giovanni/" title="Two of Elvira’s arias from Don Giovanni"&gt;Donna Elvira&lt;/a&gt;
and the &lt;a href="http://brannerchinese.wordpress.com/2011/11/12/suddenly-perceiving-the-cantus-firmus-in-a-bach-chorus/" title="Suddenly perceiving the cantus firmus in a Bach chorus"&gt;&lt;em&gt;cantus firmus&lt;/em&gt; in some of the Bach choruses&lt;/a&gt;. Because
altered perception of narrative time is related to the visceral
appreciation of music, I think of this effect as having something in
common with kinesthesia, the subjective sensation of body movement and
position, an idea and feeling of keen interest to me in my daily life
and study habits. Of course, not all music produces this effect to the
same extent and I know different listeners react differently, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Since taking the first steps toward making my peace with mathematics
almost two years ago, I have struggled with a third form of altered
time-perception: a special feeling that comes about in trying to read
and understand a mathematical idea, to fully follow or compose a proof,
to formulate and solve a problem. There has been nothing in my life up
to now as a humanist — linguistic fieldworker and student of the Chinese
script and medieval prosody — that has prepared me for this experience.
Part of the sensation is that my mind is being forced into a lower
gear-ratio: suddenly, my engine has to make many more revolutions to get
the wheels to turn just once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The low-gear feeling reminds me of a half-hour spent some years ago in a
tiny café in Longyan 龍巖, a small Chinese city where a market for
coffee developed around 2004. In order to serve my companion and me two
cups of coffee, perhaps 8 ounces in all, the café owner ground beans in
a hand-operated burr mill for ten minutes, cranking rapidly the whole
time. Long before he was done I felt embarrassed at the exertion he had
taken on himself to make a good impression on me. He had few customers
but I was the first foreigner his shop had ever had, so it was a matter
of some moment for him. He had paid a lot of money to have an expert
come up from Xiamen 廈門 to teach him how to make and serve coffee the
"right way", exactly the right way. His coffee was thin — but after all
it was pretty good, better than you would get today in one of the
big-name coffee chains here in New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In studying Classical Chinese, or reading collections of philological
notes on an ancient dictionary manuscript, or collating piles of
handwritten dialect data, you learn not to crave instantaneous
satisfaction and even to distrust any result arrived at quickly. But by
comparison with mathematics, all of those feel like short-term
activities whose conceptual finiteness is easy to demonstrate. The
reason for the difference must be that the kind of thinking we do in
solving humanistic problems does not require such continual recasting of
hypothesis and mindset, or for most of us (I hope I am not shocking
anyone) as much rigor, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the other two examples I have cited — polishing my own writing,
listening to thoughtfully constructed vocal music — the bending of time
by mathematics is unpleasant, except in retrospect after I have
succeeded in reaching a solution of some sort. I hope more practice will
bring me more facility — that is a prescription that certainly works in
studying Chinese, and it is what divides the good students from the
mediochre ones. Sometimes mediochre students are vastly more brilliant
than good ones, but Chinese requires more than brilliance for its
mastery; it also requires the investment of time in what may appear to
be drudgery. It requires, in short, commitment to some partial vision of
the future along with a willingness to ignore the clock. As for math,
impatience is certainly my chief obstacle, and impatience is one of what
Epictetus calls "things that are up to us". I have tried techniques to
increase my stamina and concentration, and to recover more quickly from
periodic cognitive exhaustion. And to suppress the arrogant expectation
that I can cut through the difficulties quickly. Nothing I have tried
helps in a way that I could call striking — I mean that nothing lives up
to my arrogant expectation that I can continue to indulge in arrogant
expectation — and most of it does not help at all, except to distract me
and waste enough time to make me feel a little cheated and frustrated
again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I think what will really matter is my own willingness to
suspend impatience and all expectation of achieving finality, to refuse
to feel them. I do not find it hard to attain this suspension on some
occasions — when I listen to Beethoven's late music — but in doing math
you are not listening; it is as though you are actually composing the
music, yourself.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Suddenly perceiving the cantus firmus in a Bach chorus</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/suddenly-perceiving-the-cantus-firmus-in-a-bach-chorus.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-11-12T21:32:00-05:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2011-11-12:suddenly-perceiving-the-cantus-firmus-in-a-bach-chorus.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the choruses that open many of the Bach cantatas, the basic
orchestral and choral setting is Baroque and flowery, but sometimes the
whole movement has been built around a &lt;em&gt;cantus firmus&lt;/em&gt; or 'fixed song',
a simple melody that would have been old in Bach's time — occasionally
reaching back to the epoch of plainsong. Many such &lt;em&gt;cantus firmi&lt;/em&gt; appear
in cantata's concluding chorales, but I find their setting within
opening choruses more striking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hearing the ancient melody emerge from within the larger setting, if I
am paying attention to the words and music, has the power to overwhelm
me because it forces me to recalibrate my mind away from the tempo and
organization of the rest of the setting. An ancient text of a few lines,
sung in an ancient melody in long notes, seems to seize control of the
rest of the choir and orchestra. It is like suddenly hearing a stern
voice from the past in the midst of more frivolous chatter around you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Striking examples include works at the edge of popular classical music,
such as BWV 140 'Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme', as well as the German
Magnificat (BWV 10 'Meine Seel erhebt den Herren'), BWV 78 'Jesu, der du
meine Seele', BWV 26 'Ach wie flüchtig, ach wie nichtig', and the somber
BWV 4 'Christ lag in Todes Banden'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Articles/CM-Schweitzer.htm"&gt;Albert Schweitzer left a fine essay&lt;/a&gt; (posted in a century-old
translation on Aryeh Oron's magnificent Bach site, bach-cantatas.com)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Bach, the bonds between the chorale and the sacred song are
completely broken. The melodies that Emmanuel Bach, Johann Joachim
Quantz, Johann Adam Hiller and Beethoven wrote, in artistic rivalry,
to Gellert's poems only show what a distance separated them all from
the chorale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the epoch of Rationalism, it is true, the melodies were not diluted
to the same extent as the text; but there was still a hard struggle
until the old melodies were again rehabilitated everywhere, and were
no longer jostled in the chorale books by the characterless tunes of
the later epoch. Now that this has been achieved, the dispute today is
as to whether we shall retain the old chorales with the uniform
note-values in which we have received them from the eighteenth
century, or whether we should restore to them their original rhythmic
variety. A definite decision, indeed, is hardly possible. Each "pro"
that can be adduced from historical, artistic, or practical
considerations is at once opposed by a "contra" of equal force in its
way. Bach is concerned in this controversy to the extent that those
who advocate the uniform polished form of chorales can plead that,
although the opposite tradition had a powerful following all round
him, he felt no artistic compulsion to revert to the old rhythmic form
of the chorale, and so there is no cogent objection, from the purely
musical point of view, against the chorale as we have received it from
his hands. Against the enthusiasts for the rhythmic melodies the old
master can plead as St. Paul once did against the Corinthians who knew
all things much better, that he too thinks he is possessed by the
spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither &lt;em&gt;flüchtig&lt;/em&gt; nor &lt;em&gt;nichtig&lt;/em&gt;, in this case.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Two of Elvira's arias from Don Giovanni</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/two-of-elviras-arias-from-don-giovanni.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-11-11T10:53:00-05:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2011-11-11:two-of-elviras-arias-from-don-giovanni.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ah, fuggi il traditor!&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Poor Elvira! But I would feel much less sorrow, and therefore less
bittersweet pleasure, if she did not prolong and repeat her lines. In
the end it is always heartbreaking to hear her final "…ancor per lui
pietà," even though I know it is coming. But the words look foolish,
even embarrassing, when I see them flat on the page, and I do not need
to see them acted at all. Only the music gives them life and time of
their own.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Identifying robots among human beings</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/identifying-robots-among-human-beings.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-11-11T09:56:00-05:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2011-11-11:identifying-robots-among-human-beings.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some of us are definitely robots and it's hypothesized that some of us

&lt;em&gt;guillemets&lt;/em&gt;. They are used in the scripts of many modern languages,

&lt;p&gt;The standard LaTeX commands to produce them, however, are

&lt;p&gt;at the start of each chapter. The TOC will have "TOC form" (supplied
between square brackets) and the chapter itself will have "text form"
(supplied between curly braces).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the TOC form itself contains a closing square bracket (&lt;code&gt;]&lt;/code&gt;), the
compiler will think the balanced brackets &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; have ended and generate
an error. But rather than escaping the extra &lt;code&gt;]&lt;/code&gt;, which may lead to
confusion with the math display environment, place the whole TOC form
within braces:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;  &lt;span class="err"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;chapter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;TOC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;closing&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;bracket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}]{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I normally use the package &lt;code&gt;titlesec&lt;/code&gt; for fine control of chapter
headings, but what is described above will work without it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that you have to compile your code twice in order to get the
TOC to be updated correctly: once to typeset the whole text, and then
once more to generate the TOC based on the typeset text.&lt;/p&gt;

John Cook's Google+ account, date 20111106&lt;/a&gt; (not sure how to link to
it for the long term):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John Cook&lt;/strong&gt;: "The softer the science, the more political it is. That
matches my experience."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lao Tzu&lt;/strong&gt;: "In maths departments, people feel they can use each
other's research so it's more collegial. In philosophy departments,
moving forward means cutting others down."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John Cook&lt;/strong&gt;: "Grants also make people less collegial. Someone at my
institution said that when the faculty were first required to cover
part of their salary in grants, people immediately began to view
colleagues as competitors and quit sharing data."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idea for a metric of "softness" in scholarship: proportion of
multi-author to single-author articles (books are more likely to be
joint projects).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though my interests are rather technical, all my articles (not books)
were single-author until I left academia and stopped having to think
about making an impression on deans and promotion committees — neither
of which I actually cared about, but which had the power to affect my
circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still want credit for my ideas and labor, but now I'm glad to share
credit for help I've received — in a byline, I mean, rather than simply
thanking people in a footnote. I feel this to be a decisively healthier
state of affairs than the way I used to work. Sharing a byline motivates
me to ask for sharing of ideas rather than just "help", and motivates
others to give more fully of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the humanities does seem to discourage collaboration. I continue to
be contacted by other scholars who want me to advise them on something
that they will publish alone, even though we could do a much better job
if we worked together. Graduate students (I won't name the institutions)
seem reluctant to do projects I've assigned unless they can turn them
into a conference paper of some sort, which in the humanities means a
single-author byline. The first really harsh review I've ever written
came out recently — among other things, I criticized the author because
he should have collaborated fully with a statistician and a historical
phonologist; instead, he merely asked for their technical help and then
drew his own conclusions and published the whole mess under his own
name.&lt;/p&gt;

Raymond's "Armed and Dangerous" blog&lt;/a&gt; has a 2003 post
("Brother, Can you Paradigm?") attacking the reputation of Thomas Kuhn's
work. I just saw it, and left the following comment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I mention Karl Popper in a lecture I can usually count on someone
telling me that Popper is discredited and I should be talking about
Kuhn and his successors, instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trouble is, Popper offers me a practical tool for intellectual
work: a reliable way of checking whether I may be deluding myself,
which may help me get nearer to the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kuhn offers me only a passive sociological interpretation of how
intellectual communities function. He may be right, but no
interpretation can replace a functioning heuristic for finding error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there's a lesson to be learned from this, it's that I shouldn't be
surprised that the world prefers Kuhn — that in itself is a lesson
about the truth of both men's ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

process becomes more or less mechanical. You can do that on your own for
the most part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you crave understanding, however, you cannot find better on-line
lectures than those of Prof. Herbert Gross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prof. Gross taught mathematics at MIT and Bunker Hill Community College
for a lifetime, and around 1970 he prepared a series of videos — the
clearest instructional films I can remember seeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main series, "Calculus Revisited", is part of &lt;a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-006-calculus-revisited-fall-2010/"&gt;MIT
OpenCourseWare&lt;/a&gt;. The multivariable calculus videos are not included
there yet, however, so has posted them himself on his own website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.adjectivenounmath.com/id93.html"&gt;Part 2: http://www.adjectivenounmath.com/id93.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.adjectivenounmath.com/id98.html"&gt;Part 3: http://www.adjectivenounmath.com/id98.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that there are extensive paper (PDF) materials intended to
supplement the videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prof. Gross's videos are far and away the best of their kind that I have
seen, and never mind that they're vintage 1969 and black and white.
(Calculus itself dates from around 1660-1860 and the era of ink and
quill.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I contacted Herb Gross earlier this year and asked him about the origins
of his project. He told me that he developed this curriculum over about
three years with Harold Mickley, the director of the Center for Advanced
Engineering Study (CAES) at MIT. It was intended for industry. Gross and
Mickley went over the lecture plans in detail to ensure that everything
was as clear as possible. No cue cards (the predecessor of the
teleprompter) were used, since the blackboard content was written out in
advance and provided a running outline of each lecture. He added, "Our
feeling is that it was fine to overload the content because people could
view the video at their own pace, pausing the video and/or fast
forwarding it as desired. To keep things from being boring or looking
'canned' to the students, we left enough space on the board for me to
interject supplementary remarks with the black chalk." I asked about the
filming schedule; he was not positive but said he thought it was two or
three videos a day twice a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said, "By MIT standards I was a mediocre math student but an
excellent math instructor." Not only an excellent instructor but a most
generous one. Herb Gross and MIT have done the calculus student an
immense service.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>The abbreviation UTC as an acronym</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/the-abbreviation-utc-as-an-acronym.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-11-06T10:06:00-05:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2011-11-06:the-abbreviation-utc-as-an-acronym.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2011/11/06/dst-is-a-mess/"&gt;"Daylight Saving Time is a huge mess"&lt;/a&gt;, posted to blog "The
Endeavor" on 20111106, John D. Cook writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The abbreviation UTC [dpb: the non-Anglocentric successor to
"Greenwich Mean Time"] is an odd compromise. The French wanted to use
the abbreviation TUC (&lt;em&gt;temps universel coordonné&lt;/em&gt;) and the English
wanted to use CUT (coordinated universal time). The compromise was
UTC, which doesn’t actually abbreviate anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, it abbreviates the squabbling between the English and the
French over whose language is to be dominant. Perhaps it is a good model
for other such cases.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Clyde Haberman on validating one's authenticity as a New Yorker (2011)</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/clyde-haberman-on-validating-ones-authenticity-as-a-new-yorker-2011.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-11-03T12:53:00-04:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2011-11-03:clyde-haberman-on-validating-ones-authenticity-as-a-new-yorker-2011.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Clyde Haberman writes:&lt;/p&gt;

mentions "the collapse of orders from the American academic market."
After 12 years in the making, our collection of my father's early and
little-known papers (on which my mother and a student of my father's
have been working interminably) is going to be looking for a new venue.
My mother is still determined to issue it in physical form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a conversation in July with a major academic publisher, I was told
that this year, for the first time, library orders of PDFs have
outstripped orders of physical books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electronic publication is very convenient, but I'm sure I'm not the only
person who has reservations about this development. Issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Persistence&lt;/strong&gt;. One of my scholarly fields involves manuscripts a
    thousand and more years old. Over the years, I've bought a couple of
    dozen editions of reproductions of these things, some with copious
    commentary and corrigenda. I'm happy at the prospect of more people
    being able to access these things in electronic format. But it
    occurs to me that these manuscripts have only survived because they
    were in physical form. I can imagine much of the written creation of
    our present day — which is disseminated far more widely than ever in
    the past — disappearing without a trace because most of it exists
    only in a state that is transient and much less stable than print
    (or inscription on stone steles).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preparation&lt;/strong&gt;. Flat text and images are easy to prepare for
    electronic publication and can be printed into the form of a
    physical book with almost no trouble on the user's part.
    Dictionaries, however, have to be organized as structured data in
    order to be useful, and that requires more complicated computational
    treatment.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&gt; I find for myself that my first thought is never my best thought. My
&gt; first thought is always someone else's; it's always what I've already
&gt; heard about the subject, always the conventional wisdom. It's only by
&gt; concentrating, sticking to the question, being patient, letting all
&gt; the parts of my mind come into play, that I arrive at an original
&gt; idea. By giving my brain a chance to make associations, draw
&gt; connections, take me by surprise. And often even that idea doesn't
&gt; turn out to be very good. I need time to think about it, too, to make
&gt; mistakes and recognize them, to make false starts and correct them, to
&gt; outlast my impulses, to defeat my desire to declare the job done and
&gt; move on to the next thing.
&gt;
&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Solitude can mean introspection, it can mean the concentration of
focused work, and it can mean sustained reading. All of these help you
to know yourself better. But there's one more thing I'm going to
include as a form of solitude, and it will seem counterintuitive:
friendship. Of course friendship is the opposite of solitude; it means
being with other people. But I'm talking about one kind of friendship
in particular, the deep friendship of intimate conversation. Long,
uninterrupted talk with one other person. … This is what we call
thinking out loud, discovering what you believe in the course of
articulating it. But it takes just as much time and just as much
patience as solitude in the strict sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&gt; **Do you have any advice for up-and-coming programmers?**
&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Know the foundations of computer science: algorithms, machine
architectures, data structures, etc. Don't just blindly copy
techniques from application to application. Know what you are doing,
that it works, and why it works. Don't think you know what the
industry will be in five years time or what you'll be doing then, so
gather a portfolio of general and useful skills. Try to write better,
more principled code. Work to make "programming" more of a
professional activity and less of a low-level "hacking" activity
(programming is also a craft, but not just a craft). Learn from the
classics in the field and the better advanced textbooks; don't be
satisfied with the easily digested "how to" guides and online
documentation - it's shallow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&gt; **Do you have any advice for up-and-coming programmers?**
&gt;
&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find an area that interests you and get involved with an existing
community. There are free software projects in just about any area of
programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The nuts-and-bolts -- which language you use, what programming
environment you use, where you do your work -- are not as important as
the passion and interest you bring to the work itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&gt; **Where does the name C++ come from?**
&gt;
&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As "C with Classes" (my ancestor to C++) became popular within Bell
Labs, some people found that name too much of a mouthful and started
to call it C. This meant that they needed to qualify what they meant
when they wanted to refer to Dennis Ritchie's language, so they used
"Old C", "Straight C", and such. Somebody found that disrespectful to
Dennis (neither Dennis nor I felt that) and one day I received a
"request" though Bell Labs management channels to find a better name.
As a result, we referred to C++ as C84 for a while. That didn't do
much good, so I asked around for suggestions and picked C++ from the
resulting list. Everybody agreed that semantically ++C would have been
even better, but I thought that would create too many problems for
non-geeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you respond to criticism of the language, such as that it has
inherited the flaws of C and that it has a very large feature set
which makes it 'bloated'?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C++ inherited the weaknesses and the strengths of C++ [sic; dpb: does
he mean C?], and I think that we have done a decent job at
compensating for the weaknesses without compromising the strengths. C
is not a simple language (its ISO standard is more than 500 pages) and
most modern languages are bigger still. Obviously, C++ (like C) is
"bloated" compared to toy languages, but not really that big compared
to other modern languages. There are solid practical reasons why all
the languages used for serious industrial work today are "bloated" -
the tasks for which they are used are large and complex beyond the
imaginations of ivory tower types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason for the unpleasantly large size of modern language is
the need for stability. I wrote C++ code 20 years ago that still runs
today and I'm confident that it will still compile and run 20 years
from now. People who build large infrastructure projects need such
stability. However, to remain modern and to meet new challenges, a
language must grow (either in language features or in foundation
libraries), but if you remove anything, you break code. Thus,
languages that are built with serious concern for their users (such as
C++ and C) tend to accrete features over the decades, tend to become
bloated. The alternative is beautiful languages for which you have to
rewrite your code every five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Finally, C++ deliberately and from day #1 supported more than one
programming style and the interaction of those programming styles. If
you think that there is one style of programming that is best for all
applications and all people - say, object-oriented programming - then
you have an opportunity for simplification. However, I firmly believe
that the best solutions - the most readable, maintainable, efficient,
etc., solutions - to large classes of problems require more than one
of the popular programming styles - say, both object-oriented
programming and generic programming - so the size of C++ cannot be
minimized by supporting just one programming style. This use of
combinations of styles of programming is a key part of my view of C++
and a major part of its strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you were teaching up-and-coming programmers, what would you
say?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I would be somewhat intimidated because they all know more than
I do these days! And the environments today are so much more
complicated than when I wrote code. Having said that software
engineering hasn’t changed much over the years. The thing we practised
in the Unix group was if you wrote some code then you were personally
accountable for that code working and if you put that code into public
use and it didn’t work then it was your reputation that was at stake.
In the Unix lab there were about 20 people who used the system every
day and we installed our software on the PDP 11 that everyone else was
using. And if it didn’t work you got yelled at rather quickly. So we
all tested our programs as much as we could before releasing them to
the group. I think that this is important these days – it’s so easy in
these large software projects to write code and not understand the
environment you will be operating in very well, so it doesn’t work
when you release the code in the real world. That is one piece of
advice I’d give is to make sure you understand who is using your code
and what they will use it for. If you can, go and visit your customers
and find out what they are doing with your code. Also be sure to
understand the environment that your program will be deployed into.
Lastly, take pride in your code so that your peers and customers alike
will appreciate your skill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&gt; Language design is a very personal activity and each person brings to
&gt; a language the classes of problems that they'd like to solve, and the
&gt; manner in which they'd like them to be solved. I had a lot of fun
&gt; creating AWK, and working with Kernighan and Weinberger was one of the
&gt; most stimulating experiences of my career. I also learned I would not
&gt; want to get into a programming contest with either of them however!
&gt; Their programming abilities are formidable.
&gt;
&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, we did not intend the language to be used except by the
three of us. But very quickly we discovered lots of other people had
the need for the routine kind of data processing that AWK was good
for. People didn't want to write hundred-line C programs to do data
processing that could be done with a few lines of AWK, so lots of
people started using AWK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[The name] was not our choice. When our research colleagues saw the
three of us in one or another's office, they'd walk by the open door
and say 'AWK! AWK!'. So, we called the language AWK because of the
good natured ribbing we received from our colleagues. We also thought
it was a great name, and we put the AUK bird picture on the AWK book
when we published it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
What AWK represents is a beautiful marriage of theory and practice.
The best engineering is often built on top of a sound scientific
foundation. In AWK we have taken expressive notations and efficient
algorithms founded in computer science and engineered them to run well
in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&gt; The fundamental idea behind verification is that one should think
&gt; about what a program is supposed to do before writing it. Thinking is
&gt; a difficult process that requires a lot of effort. Write a book based
&gt; on a selection of distorted anecdotes showing that instincts are
&gt; superior to rational judgment and you get a best seller. Imagine how
&gt; popular a book would be that urged people to engage in difficult study
&gt; to develop their ability to think so they could rid themselves of the
&gt; irrational and often destructive beliefs they now cherish. So, trying
&gt; to get people to think is dangerous. Over the centuries, many have
&gt; been killed in the attempt. Fortunately, when applied to programming
&gt; rather than more sensitive subjects, preaching rational thought leads
&gt; to polite indifference rather than violence. However, the small number
&gt; of programmers who are willing to consider such a radical alternative
&gt; to their current practice will find that thinking offers great
&gt; benefits. Spending a few hours thinking before writing code can save
&gt; days of debugging and rewriting.
&gt;
&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of doing something before coding is not so radical. Any
number of methods, employing varying degrees of formalism, have been
advocated. Many of them involve drawing pictures. The implicit message
underlying them is that these methods save you from the difficult task
of thinking. If you just use the right language or draw the right kind
of pictures, everything will become easy. The best of these methods
trick you into thinking. They offer some incentive in the way of tools
or screen-flash that sugar coats the bitter pill of having to think
about what you’re doing. The worst give you a happy sense of
accomplishment and leave you with no more understanding of what your
program is supposed to do than you started with. The more a method
depends on pictures, the more likely it is to fall in the latter
class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At best, a method or language or formalism can help you to think in
one particular way. And there is no single way of thinking that is
best for all problems. I can offer only two general pieces of advice
on how to think. The first is to write. As the cartoonist Guindon once
wrote, “writing is nature’s way of showing you how fuzzy your thinking
is.” Before writing a piece of code, write a description of exactly
what that piece of code is supposed to accomplish. This applies
whether the piece is an entire program, a procedure, or a few lines of
code that are sufficiently non-obvious to require thought. The best
place to write such a description is in a comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People have come up with lots of reasons for why comments are useless.
This is to be expected. Writing is difficult, and people always find
excuses to avoid doing difficult tasks. Writing is difficult for two
reasons: (i) writing requires thought and thinking is difficult, and
(ii) the physical act of putting thoughts into words is difficult.
There’s not much you can do about (i), but there’s a straightforward
solution to (ii) — namely, writing. The more you write, the easier the
physical process becomes. I recommend that you start practicing with
email. Instead of just dashing off an email, write it. Make sure that
it expresses exactly what you mean to say, in a way that the reader
will be sure to understand it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Remember that I am not telling you to comment your code after you
write it. You should comment code before you write it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

2004-06), I had trouble with ballpoint pens, which often got clogged by
the relatively rough copy paper I printed my surveys on. I tried
fountain pens but the Chinese ink was not waterproof, and field notes
may come into contact with rain, tea, river water, or Heaven knows what
else at any moment, so it's best to use a waterproof or even archival
ink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I eventually switched to an inexpensive model of Rapidograph, which I
bought in the US during a short visit in 1994. The fineness of the point
was very helpful for the work, although I had periodic problems with
clogging. Later, I discovered the Staedtler Mars marker pens, which have
replaceable cartridges. I used those for a number of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late in my fieldworking life, I began using Sakura Pigma Micron pens.
Like the Mars, Microns are basically very fine markers, rather than true
technical pens. But they tend not to become blunted or to dry out
quickly, and there is no problem about refilling them or replacing a
cartridge. Their ink is archival quality, which means it is indelible
and pH-neutral. As long as you keep a spare handy, your fieldwork can
proceed smoothly and your notes should remain legible for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now use a computer for almost all writing and note-taking tasks, but I
still carry Micron pens with me everywhere. There are several
inexpensive sources for them in New York and on line.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>How I learned LaTeX</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/how-i-learned-latex.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-10-29T19:20:00-04:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2011-10-29:how-i-learned-latex.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;LateX is Leslie Lamport's document preparation system based on Donald
Knuth's TeX typesetting language. Although at times rather complicated,
it is the most powerful tool available to people like me for typesetting
and formatting documents. I failed to learn it after several serious
attempts, but one day I essentially placed myself in a situation where I
had to learn it in order to function, and that worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1994 my wife and I were doing heavy dialect fieldwork in rural
Fújiàn, but our visas ended in the Spring and we left China to look in
on family and prepare for the next bout of fieldwork. At that time, the
University of Washington had a little humanities computing center, where
I went to get help with various computing tools. While there, I heard
one of the staff making an enthusiastic plug for LaTeX. That must have
been just after the Mittelbach/Goossens &lt;em&gt;LaTeX Companion&lt;/em&gt; appeared. I
found the software hard to install and soon gave up. In those days, I
took my field notes by hand with technical pens and transferred them to
Microsoft Word files, using a Macintosh font of my own design that had
all the phonetic symbols I needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That situation repeated itself a few times in the following years. Norm
Kabir made a valiant effort to interest me in LyX in 2006, knowing of my
desire to automate the typesetting of database dumps. but I gave up
again after difficulties with installation and with typesetting Chinese
text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Spring of 2010, however, while taking math courses at City
College, I began to feel frustrated reviewing my handwritten notes or
searching through them to find some example or detail. I tried taking
notes on a simple text editor, but there were inevitable problems
representing the more complicated mathematical forms. At the start of
the Fall semester, remembering LaTeX, I installed the Mac "TeXShop"
editor and spent one evening learning the most basic commands, choosing
a command reference card to have handy all the time, and setting up a
simple template. After tentative note-taking in a couple of classes
early in the term, on 14 November I took the plunge and began using
LaTeX for all in-class writing apart from exams. I have done so ever
since, and am now able to reproduce just about everything I ever see in
the classroom, except for actual drawings. (LaTeX tables remain
time-consuming, and tree diagrams are just passable in the &lt;code&gt;\verbatim&lt;/code&gt;
environment.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm a strong believer in the value of proficiency, to be cultivated by
hands-on practice and even rote repetition, rather than understanding
alone — because when we think we understand, we sometimes don't really.
And I'm convinced that the way to learn LaTeX is by forcing oneself to
use it all the time. The pressure of real-time transcription forced me
to solve problems on the fly and find ways to retain what I had learned,
and I think that is the best way to approach a complex tool like LaTeX.
If I had waited until it was convenient to learn it, I would probably
never have done so at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(My initial template was for LaTeX proper, but I have since switched to
XeLaTeX in order to get better support for Chinese.)&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Some bons mots from Edsger Dijkstra (1984)</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/some-bons-mots-from-edsgar-dijkstra-1984.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-10-28T10:57:00-04:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2011-10-28:some-bons-mots-from-edsgar-dijkstra-1984.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gone are the days when Niklaus Wirth unmistakably identified himself
by his typewriter and you could recognize his writings even when they
were held upside down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Nowadays machines are so fast and stores are so huge that in a very
true sense the computations we can evoke defy our imagination. Machine
capacities now give us room galore for making a mess of it.
Opportunities unlimited for fouling things up! Developing the austere
intellectual discipline of keeping things sufficiently simple is in
this environment a formidable challenge, both technically and
educationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Complexity continues to have a morbid attraction. When you give for an
academic audience a lecture that is crystal clear from alpha to omega,
your audience feels cheated and leaves the lecture hall commenting to
each other: "That was rather trivial, wasn't it?" The sore truth is
that complexity sells better. (It is not only the computer industry
that has discovered that.) And it is even more diabolical in that we
even use the complexity of our own constructs to impress ourselves. I
have often been impressed by the cleverness of my own first solutions;
invariably the joy of the subsequent discovery how to streamline the
argument was tempered by a feeling of regret that my cleverness was
unnecessary after all. It is a genuine sacrifice to part from one's
ingenuities, no matter how contorted, Also, many a programmer derives
a major part of his professional excitement from not quite
understanding what he is doing, from the daring risks he takes and
from the struggle to find the bugs he should not have introduced in
the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The intrinsic difficulty of the programming task has never been
refuted, it has only been denied because admitting it was socially
unacceptable. Not surprisingly, research in programming methodology
has not flourished in societies unable to admit that the programming
problem was serious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Software engineering … has sought to replace intellectual discipline
by management discipline to the extent that it has now accepted as its
charter "How to program if you cannot."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Taken literally, ["user-friendliness"] is like the term "motherhood":
nobody can be against it, so it means nothing. And hence, if the term
"user-friendliness" is given a meaning, it must be a terrible
euphemism for something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
It is regrettable that large groups only come to their senses after
their day-dreams have turned into nightmares but, this being so, we
should occasionally welcome the nightmares.&lt;/p&gt;

harsher piece by Maureen Dowd refreshing: &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/26/opinion/limits-of-magical-thinking.html?pagewanted=print"&gt;The Limits of Magical
Thinking (NYT, 20111025)&lt;/a&gt;. In 850 words, she remembers his mood
swings, obsession with control, and unpleasant behavior in relationships
with women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two reflections:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's not clear to me that knowing more details about someone's life
    — especially those based on hearsay — necessarily increases my
    understanding of how his mind is organized, and that is one of the
    central things to think about in this life. But at a minimum,
    hearing unpleasant details in a brief, literate column is an
    antidote to the overreporting about celebrities that gushes through
    much of the media.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During the years when I was a a strictly non-technical consumer of
    technology, I was enthusiastic about the Macintosh brand and Apple,
    and their underdog status didn't lessen their charm. More recently I
    have felt turned off by Apple's restrictive design decisions, to say

Tree algorithm from Chapter 13 of &lt;em&gt;Introduction to Algorithms&lt;/em&gt;, 3rd ed.,
by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein. In a number of places I found
the pseudo-code hard to implement, and devoted considerable time to
annotating it. For the benefit of others who may be attempting the same
project, I offer my annotations here of the RB-DELETE and
RB-DELETE-FIXUP functions, which were the most difficult to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was obvious in 1971 and even in 1958 that AI programs suffered from
a lack of generality. It is still obvious, and now there are many more
details. The first gross symptom is that a small addition to the idea
of a program often involves a complete rewrite beginning with the data
structures. Some progress has been made in modularizing data
structures, but small modifications of the search strategies are even
less likely to be accomplished without rewriting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another symptom is that no-one knows how to make a general database of
common sense knowledge that could be used by any program that needed
the knowledge. Along with other information, such a database would
contain what a robot would need to know about the effects of moving
objects around, what a person can be expected to know about his
family, and the facts about buying and selling. This doesn't depend on
whether the knowledge is to be expressed in a logical language or in
some other formalism. When we take the logic approach to AI, lack of
generality shows up in that the axioms we devise to express common
sense knowledge are too restricted in their applicability for a
general common sense database. In my opinion, getting a language for
expressing general common sense knowledge for inclusion in a general
database is the key problem of generality in AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Production systems represent knowledge in the form of facts and rules,
and there is almost always a sharp syntactic distinction between the
two. The facts usually correspond to ground instances of logical
formulas, i.e. the correspond to predicate symbols applied to constant
expressions. Unlike logic-based systems, these facts contain no
variables or quantifiers. New facts are produced by inference,
observation and user input. Variables are reserved for rules, which
usually take a pattern-action form. Rules are put in the system by the
programmer or ``knowledge engineer'' and in most systems cannot
arise via the action of the system. In exchange for accepting these
limitations, the production system programmer gets a relatively fast
program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seemed to me in 1958 that small modifications in behavior are most
often representable as small modifications in beliefs about the world,
and this requires a system that represents beliefs explicitly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;``If one wants a machine to be able to discover an abstraction, it
seems most likely that the machine must be able to represent this
abstraction in some relatively simple way'' (McCarthy 1959).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1958 idea for increasing generality was to use logic to express
facts in a way independent of the way the facts might subsequently be
used. It seemed then and still seems that &lt;strong&gt;humans communicate mainly
in declarative sentences rather than in programming languages for good
objective reasons that will apply whether the communicator is a human,
a creature from Alpha Centauri or a computer program.&lt;/strong&gt; Moreover, the
advantages of declarative information also apply to internal
representation. The advantage of declarative information is one of
generality. The fact that when two objects collide they make a noise
may be used in particular situations to make a noise, to avoid making
noise, to explain a noise or to explain the absence of noise. (I guess
those cars didn't collide, because while I heard the squeal of brakes,
I didn't hear a crash).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every increase in expressive power carries a price in the required
complexity of the reasoning and problem solving programs. To put it
another way, accepting limitations on the expressiveness of one's
declarative information allows simplification of the search
procedures.&lt;/strong&gt; Prolog represents a local optimum in this continuum,
because Horn clauses are medium expressive but can be interpreted
directly by a logical problem solver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One major limitation that is usually accepted is to limit the
derivation of new facts to formulas without variables, i.e to
substitute constants for variables and then do propositional
reasoning. It appears that most human daily activity involves only
such reasoning. In principle, Prolog goes slightly beyond this,
because the expressions found as values of variables by Prolog
programs can themselves involve free variables. However, this facility
is rarely used except for intermediate results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can't be done without more of predicate calculus than Prolog
allows is universal generalization.&lt;/p&gt;

magic commands that have been made silently obsolete. I was surprised to
find the useful &lt;code&gt;store&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; commands gone, and it turns out there
are several others. Based on a comparison of the Quick Reference Cards,
I note the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;%bg&lt;/code&gt;: Run a job in the background, in a separate thread.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;%color_info&lt;/code&gt;: Toggle color_info.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;%p&lt;/code&gt;: Just a short alias for Python's 'print'.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;%r&lt;/code&gt;: Repeat previous input.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;%rehash&lt;/code&gt;: Update the alias table with all entries in \$PATH.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;%runlog&lt;/code&gt;: Run files as logs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;%store&lt;/code&gt;: Lightweight persistence for python variables.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;%system_verbose&lt;/code&gt;: Set verbose printing of system calls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;%upgrade&lt;/code&gt;: Upgrade your IPython installation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears IPython's syntax is basically unchanged, but see the
&lt;a href="http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/whatsnew/version0.11.html"&gt;official "what's new" documentation&lt;/a&gt;. Less urgently, but since I'm on
the subject, the following new commands have been added:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;%gui&lt;/code&gt;: Enable or disable IPython GUI event loop integration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;%install_default_config&lt;/code&gt;: Install IPython's default config file
    into the .ipython dir.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;%install_profiles&lt;/code&gt;: Install the default IPython profiles into the
    .ipython dir.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;%load_ext&lt;/code&gt;: Load an IPython extension by its module name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;%loadpy&lt;/code&gt;: Load a .py python script into the GUI console.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;%pastebin&lt;/code&gt;: Upload code to the 'Lodge it' paste bin, returning the
    URL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;%pinfo2&lt;/code&gt;: Provide extra detailed information about an object.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;%pprint&lt;/code&gt;: Toggle pretty printing on/off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;%precision&lt;/code&gt;: Set floating point precision for pretty printing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;%pylab&lt;/code&gt;: Load numpy and matplotlib to work interactively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;%recall&lt;/code&gt;: Repeat a command, or get command to input line for
    editing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;%reload_ext&lt;/code&gt;: Reload an IPython extension by its module name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;%rerun&lt;/code&gt;: Re-run previous input&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getters and setters are evil. Evil, evil, I say! Python objects are

should write getters and setters, and then wrap them in 'property'.
That means that until you prove that you need anything more than a
simple attribute access, &lt;strong&gt;don't write getters and setters&lt;/strong&gt;. They are
a waste of CPU time, but more important, they are a waste of
programmer time. Not just for the people writing the code and tests,
but for the people who have to read and understand them as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;code&gt;locate&lt;/code&gt;, used at the command-line prompt for finding currently
installed files in readable directories on the system. On Mac OS X, not
only does &lt;code&gt;updatedb&lt;/code&gt; have to be run manually from
&lt;code&gt;/usr/libexec/locate.updatedb&lt;/code&gt;, but for some reason &lt;code&gt;locate&lt;/code&gt; apparently

Barnum's reputation</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/reconsider-p-t-barnums-reputation.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-10-20T10:12:00-04:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2011-10-20:reconsider-p-t-barnums-reputation.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;
&gt; Rather than suggest that Barnum was out to make his fortune by duping
&gt; a gullible public, Mr. [Arthur] Saxon is now convinced that Barnum was
&gt; the exact opposite: a sensitive and tolerant individual with a sense
&gt; of mission who believed in giving the public a good laugh for only
&gt; pennies, and fought hard for unpopular, progressive causes such as
&gt; women's rights, freedom for slaves and against the machine-dominated
&gt; politics of his day.
&gt;
&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is not a whit of evidence, suggested Mr. Saxon, that Barnum ever
said anything as callous as, "There's a sucker born every minute."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There's no contemporary account of it," said Mr. Saxon, "or even any
suggestion that the word 'sucker' was used in the derogatory sense in
his day. Barnum was just not the type to disparage his patrons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I'll admit, he loved a good show; a hoax. But the whole idea was that
the audience would get a laugh out of being taken in and consider it
part of the entertainment, rather than feel cheated. Barnum was not
even above being duped himself and turning it to his advantage."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, Mr. Saxon tells of the cherry-colored cat. "In probably
the most reliable version," said Mr. Saxon, "a woman writes to Barnum
asking him to give her \$25 for her cherry-colored cat. Crackpots were
always writing to Barnum with curiosities like a three-legged chicken
or a genuine mermaid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"So he said, 'Sure, bring it over.' So the woman arrives with a cat in
a bag and dumps it on the table. But it's a black cat. 'I've been
duped,' cries Barnum. 'No sir,' says the lady, 'some cherries are
black.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"Barnum liked the idea so much he put the cat on display," Mr. Saxon
said. "And sure enough, the public loved it, too, so much so that they
would not even give away the secret to their friends."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

languages do. I observe three strategies in use to simulate them, none
effective. &lt;em&gt;[Edit:]&lt;/em&gt; I don't advocate this; it's not Pythonic. But it's
useful to be able to recognize in code one is reading or contributing
to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One convention is that a leading single underscore can be use as an
"advisory" or "soft" privacy notation. So a method named &lt;code&gt;method()&lt;/code&gt; is
meant to be public, while &lt;code&gt;_method()&lt;/code&gt; is supposed to be treated as
private. The leading underscore helps coders to remember not to use it,
although there is no way to keep them from using it if they want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second strategy is the use of such things as private class variables.
These exist mainly not for the sake of privacy but to avoid collisions
between variables with the same name that originate in different
classes. They are marked as private by the use of two distinguishing
characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they are named with a leading "dunder" (double underscore, i.e.,
    &lt;code&gt;__&lt;/code&gt;).
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"mangling" (alteration) of their names: in order to access them
    outside of their own class, you prefix the dunder with an additional
    single underscore and the name of the class itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
For instance, if you have a class called &lt;code&gt;TheClass&lt;/code&gt; containing a method
called &lt;code&gt;__method()&lt;/code&gt;, the method can be called on some object &lt;code&gt;thing&lt;/code&gt; not
as plain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&gt; thing.\_\_method()

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&gt; thing.\_TheClass\_\_method()

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have posted a little piece of code called &lt;code&gt;degrees_of_privacy.py&lt;/code&gt; to
my &lt;a href="https://bitbucket.org/dpb/degrees_of_privacy"&gt;BitBucket repository&lt;/a&gt; to illustrate the syntax and effects of this
and the "advisory" usages. But even these supposedly private variables
are fully accessible outside of their own classes, as long as they are
correctly named, unlike true private member variables in C++ and other
languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
A third strategy I have observed is that some coders use a single
underscore before the &lt;em&gt;public&lt;/em&gt; form of a variable's name and no
underscore before the nominally private form of the same variable. In
2009, &lt;a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/576817-red-black-tree"&gt;John Reid posted code for a red black tree&lt;/a&gt; with a class
definition beginning this way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&gt; class rbnode(object):
&gt;
&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;def __init__(self, key):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;self._key = key&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The point is that (based on a reading of Reid's code) &lt;code&gt;key&lt;/code&gt; is
apparently meant to be a private variable and &lt;code&gt;_key&lt;/code&gt; a public one.
Similarly, Bruno Preiss, in his [interesting 2003 on-line book of data
structures and algorithms in Python][] uses syntax of the form:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&gt; class Element(object):
&gt;
&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;def __init__(self, list, datum, next):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;self._list = list&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
self._datum = datum&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
self._next = next&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Again, &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt; seems meant to be private and &lt;code&gt;_list&lt;/code&gt; public. There is a
similar prescription in the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutator_method#Python_example"&gt;Wikipedia article on mutator methods&lt;/a&gt;
(accessed 20111017):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&gt; class Student():
&gt;
&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;def __init__(self, name):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;self._name = name&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
I wonder where this syntax comes from, since the official Python
documentation and reference books I have consulted do not mention it,
and after all these variables cannot be private in the true sense. Reid
and Preiss enforce their private variables as static (unmodifiable or
read-only) by use of the &lt;code&gt;property()&lt;/code&gt; function with the &lt;code&gt;fget&lt;/code&gt; function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&gt; key = property(fget=lambda self: self.\_key, doc="The node's key")

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(from Reid). Here &lt;code&gt;_key&lt;/code&gt; can be changed outside of the class itself, but
&lt;code&gt;key&lt;/code&gt; cannot in the absence of &lt;code&gt;fset&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;fdel&lt;/code&gt; as an argument of
&lt;code&gt;property()&lt;/code&gt;. That is just the opposite of the "advisory" leading
underscore described near the beginning of this posting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't help thinking that I am looking at indirect influence from C++.
Reid and Preiss are both modeling nodes — Reid for a binary tree and
Preiss for a linked list, both structures for which a language with
pointers would be natural. Reid (following the pseudocode in the
algorithms book by Cormen &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;.) has some objects of the form&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&gt; z.p.p.right

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;meaning the &lt;code&gt;right&lt;/code&gt; attribute of an object &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;, which is itself the
attribute of a different object &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;, itself the attribute of still
another object &lt;code&gt;z&lt;/code&gt;. I can't think of a simpler way than this to model
the nodes of graphs and trees in Python, though it does call to mind a
similar pointer construction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&gt; ((z-\&gt;p)-\&gt;p)-\&gt;right

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in C++. Perhaps this is an earlier version (or a recollection) of forms
like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&gt; \_TheClass\_\_method()

&lt;/p&gt;

&gt; Computer science is different from … more traditional disciplines.
&gt; Philosophically it differs from the physical sciences because it seeks
&gt; not to discover, explain, or exploit the natural world, but instead to
&gt; study the properties of machines of human creation. In this it is
&gt; analogous to mathematics, and indeed the "science" part of computer
&gt; science is, for the most part, mathematical in spirit. But an
&gt; inevitable aspect of computer science is the creation of computer
&gt; programs: objects that, though intangible, are subject to commercial
&gt; exchange.
&gt;
&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More than anything else, the greatest danger to good computer
science research today may be &lt;em&gt;excessive&lt;/em&gt; relevance.&lt;/strong&gt; Evidence for
the worldwide fascination with computers is everywhere, from the
articles on the financial, and even the front pages of the newspapers,
to the difficulties that even the most prestigious universities
experience in finding and keeping faculty in computer science. The
best professors, instead of teaching bright students, join start-up
companies, and often discover that their brightest students have
preceded them. Computer science is in the limelight, especially those
aspects, such as systems, languages, and machine architecture, that
may have immediate commercial applications. The attention is
flattering, but it can work to the detriment of good research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the intensity of research in a particular area increases, so does
the impulse to keep its results secret. This is true even in the
university … although in academia there is a strong counterpressure:
Unless one publishes, one never becomes known at all. In industry, a
natural impulse of the establishment is to guard proprietary
information. Researchers understand reasonable restrictions on what
and when they publish, but many will become irritated and flee
elsewhere, or start working in less delicate areas, if prevented from
communicating their discoveries and inventions in suitable fashion. …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another danger is that commercial pressures of one sort or another
will divert the attention of the best thinkers from real innovation to
exploitation of the current fad, from prospecting to mining a known
lode. These pressures manifest themselves not only in the
disappearance of faculty into industry, but also in the conservatism
that overtakes those with well-paying investments — intellectual or
financial — in a given idea. Perhaps this effect explains why so few
interesting software systems have come from the large computer
companies; they are locked into the existing world. …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Partly because they are new and still immature, and partly because
they are a creation of the intellect, the arts and sciences of
software abridge the chain, usual in physics and engineering, between
fundamental discoveries, advanced development, and application. The
inventors of ideas about how software should work usually find it
necessary to build demonstration systems. For large systems, and for
revolutionary ideas, much time is required: It can be said that UNIX
was written in the 70s to distill the best systems ideas of the 60s,
and became the commonplace of the 80s. …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

with &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; a string rather than an integer — corresponding to 32- vs.
64-bit architectures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Of the &lt;code&gt;random.seed(x)&lt;/code&gt; function, Beazley (&lt;em&gt;Python Essential Reference&lt;/em&gt;,
4th ed., p. 254) writes: "If &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is not an integer, it must be a
hashable object and the value of &lt;code&gt;hash(x)&lt;/code&gt; is used as a seed."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://docs.python.org/release/2.6.6/glossary.html#term-hashable"&gt;Python documentation website&lt;/a&gt; says, "All of Python’s immutable
built-in objects are hashable, while no mutable containers (such as
lists or dictionaries) are. Objects which are instances of user-defined
classes are hashable by default; they all compare unequal, and their
hash value is their &lt;code&gt;id()&lt;/code&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strings are immutable in Python. Integers simply hash to their own
values, so they're naturally the same on all installations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Edit: I've added a little piece of code I used to explore the Python 2.6
hashing function to my public repository on [BitBucket:

instantiation of &lt;code&gt;vi&lt;/code&gt;, one of the old text editors from the days of the
"editor wars" before Bill Gates and Steve Jobs and their wares were
fixtures in the media and our households.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the editor wars, &lt;code&gt;vi&lt;/code&gt; was the great rival of Emacs — this
relationship has been &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_Wars"&gt;described with precision and acerbity
elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;, but they and their adherents were once the Punch and Judy
of programmers' intellectual world. They were seen as tokens of
competing outlooks and much was made of the rivalry. When I got back
into programming, I knew I would have to revive my long-deferred
relationship with them. I had already found &lt;code&gt;vi&lt;/code&gt; to suit my temperament
more happily, but its learning curve is steeper so I took up Emacs
first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two striking things about Emacs were its great power and the
unfamiliar way that familiar tasks were named and conceived of. Its
power is the reason to use it; the vocabulary and ideas are the price of
that power. For instance, copying and pasting text are not part of Emacs
— they come from the Jobs/Gates world. In Emacs there is no "clipboard"
but there is a "kill-ring", where pieces of text go when when you "kill"
them with \^-k. The kill-ring is a stack structure of what we would now
call clipboards, where you can find different things you have killed, if
you have saved the with "kill-ring-save" (meta-key plus w). If you want
to use something in the kill-ring, you "yank-pop" it back with \^-y.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote this about a year ago, when I was struggling to adapt to Emacs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't think copy; think kill-ring-save;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;don't think paste; think yank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strange new terms are things to save;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;let your mind be their bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got reasonably comfortable with Emacs. It is a work of abiding
quality, though as I had anticipated, not entirely perfect for me. Now I
am ready to deal with Vim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend recently wrote to say that he had become addicted to Vim and,
despite the burden of many grave professional obligations, has found
himself spending dozens of hours adjusting the settings it to suit
himself. The first thing he did was remap the equivalents of copy and
paste to the familiar key-commands \^-c and \^-v, and at some point
after that he awoke to find himself tumbling down a steep passageway of
editor configuration without end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I told him not to feel guilty, because there are just two kinds of
people: those who live on friendly terms with tools and those who don't.
We have no choice as to which kind we are. Tool-people need to spend
time mastering and adjusting their tools. It is an act of
self-fulfillment and neither to be rushed nor disparaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not tell him that for myself, copy/paste are among the very last
things I would change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The familiar Jobs/Gates conception of word-processing, and therefore its
characteristic terminology, and therefore also its system of key
commands, represents a model of thinking to which I would like to have
alternatives. That was one of the big appeals about Emacs, frankly — and
about Awk and TeX and Vim, all survivors from decades ago. These things,
coelacanths in the ocean of modern computing, seem to me to possess a
goodness of their own just because they represent a competing vision of
how to work and how to use basic tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, more than even Vim and Emacs in particular, is what attracts me
about old utilities that have survived into the new dispensation. Using
them well means training my mind to unfamiliar processes and
conceptions, and that gives me a feeling of great well-being. The hunt
is not about the fox.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Shark fin and the economics of Chinese "face"</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/shark-fin-and-the-economics-of-chinese-face.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-10-09T08:21:00-04:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2011-10-09:shark-fin-and-the-economics-of-chinese-face.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A student wrote to me for background information about the use of shark
fin in Chinese cuisine, in connection with the ban in California. I
replied:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main reason for the cultural value of shark fin soup has to do
with the Chinese tradition of "face", i.e., showing respect for the
public prestige of one's guests. The fins themselves (called &lt;em&gt;yúchì&lt;/em&gt;
魚翅 'fish wings') contribute a distinctive texture to soups made from
them. This texture is hard to replicate from other ingredients, and it
is true that Chinese cuisine places great emphasis on texture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But texture itself is only indirectly the cause of the shark fin's
value. The actual reason is that since the thing is so hard to
replicate and so expensive, providing it for my guests is a way of
showing them "face" — showing them that I am willing to go to trouble
and expense for them. The intrinsic qualities of the food are much
less important than the fact that the expense and distinctiveness of
those qualities make it a good token for showing respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making shark fin illegal would certainly increase the "face" value of
the food still further. I have been served several endangered species
at official or semi-official banquets in China. They were not
particularly tasty — pangolin, in particular, I found quite vile — but
by serving them to me and my sponsors, the host was showing respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a central element of Chinese culture, and if you think about
it, not totally unrelated to ideas you can observe in American
society. The next time you are in a fancy Western restaurant, look for
items that are more expensive than their intrinsic character would
warrant. Ever see chocolate cake with gold leaf on it? Exactly how
much flavor do you think gold leaf has?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
If you want a better analogy with regard to environmental impact,
consider this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you talk to businesspeople in the US, you'll hear some of them say
that regulation of industry and substances is futile because it
increases the motivation to break the law, increasing the cost of
regulation in a spiral because of the continual need for further
enforcement. Making a substance illegal raises its price and gives
dealers both the reason and the resources to break the law, bribe law
enforcement, and defend their businesses with violence. Placing
tariffs on an import increases the motivation to smuggle it, to
misreport sales and import figures, and to bribe customs agents. Etc.
You will find many people in this country who say they believe in this
principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the more severe the consequences of supporting trade in
endangered animals, the higher the value of serving it to an honored
guest in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you believe, as many Chinese people do, that institutions are
intrinsically corrupt and personal relationships are the most
important thing, then you can see why these foods continue to be
served.&lt;/p&gt;

just saw one of the obituaries (&lt;a href="http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/theday/obituary.aspx?n=bernard-donald-branner-barney&amp;amp;pid=153058951"&gt;reposted at legacy.com&lt;/a&gt; from an
original in &lt;a href="https://www.theday.com/"&gt;The Day of New London&lt;/a&gt;), which mentions a "final toast
and raspberry cheer".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had not heard of this custom before, but apparently his friends and
loving children sent him off with what is also known as a Bronx cheer.
(He was born in the Bronx.) That would not have been out of character
for him as a last request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, his closest youngsters went out in a boat and took turns
ladling his ashes — mixed with those of my aunt Julie from 17 years ago
— into the Niantic River a few hundred feet from what was once the
family home. My cupful of ashes contained a good proportion of bone
fragments. There is still a lot of junk in his house to be disposed of,
as well as the house itself, but that burden has not fallen to me. So
yesterday's little ceremony on the water was, for me, a most
satisfactory farewell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My uncle tried all his life to write "the Great American Novel", an
ambition for which his many gifts — chiefly working with his hands — did
not qualify him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barney met Aunt Julie when he was 16 and they were both smitten. Family
pressures separated them, and they married other people. But on his
return from the Korean war he found her single and courted her again,
divorced his wife, and at age 32 finally married her. Seeing the family
home yesterday, my grandfather's retirement home and the place where
Barney and Julie lived for the first 20 years or so of their marriage, I
see that my uncle's real novel was his happy life with Julie, an honest
love story of the sort you don't often encounter. The last line of that
romance was apparently written on the Niantic yesterday morning.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>An important skill for instructors</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/an-important-skill-for-instructors.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-09-27T18:09:00-04:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2011-09-27:an-important-skill-for-instructors.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I think this skill is best described near the end of Chapter 1 of le

character: a composite of two or more graphs for living words, all of
which are to be read (in order) to give the meaning of the word
represented by the whole character. It is something different from the
conventional notion of the “ideograph” or &lt;em&gt;huìyìzì&lt;/em&gt; 會意字, the
juxtaposition of graphs representing ideas or objects that contribute
abstractly to the overall meaning of the word represented. I have shown
elsewhere that characters are read through a process of recognition
rather than decipherment, arguing that “complex pictograph” is a better
description of the “motivation” (basis of character structure) of many
graphs traditionally considered &lt;em&gt;huìyì&lt;/em&gt; (Branner 2009). But the
portmanteau is a different case. Its components are not abstract;
understanding its structure depends on actually reading these components
as connected words to form a phrase that defines or denotes the word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper reviews a number of portmanteaux in current use and considers
their place in Chinese grammatology. Such characters are of course part
of the history of cursive Chinese and seem to have begun to be discussed
rather late in the received history of Chinese writing, around the sixth
century c.e.; it is doubtful that they could be strictly the same as the
&lt;em&gt;huìyì&lt;/em&gt; mentioned in the first-century &lt;em&gt;Shuōwén jiězì&lt;/em&gt; 說文解字.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of their structure and their relationship to oral words,
portmanteaux embody a conception different from most mainstream
characters. Their construction is more self-conscious than other
character-types, which suggests that they are a later development. Their
relationship to oral words is tenuous and tends to change frequently.&lt;/p&gt;

good for producing a certain effect, and my guess is he desires that
effect. He doesn't hold with electronic bulletin boards and just hands
out a multi-generationally photocopied one-page syllabus with the
current year's changes marked in pen. It is usually not straight on the

alternately at the board or at a corner of the ceiling at the back of
the room — though he does engage occasionally in a sort of Socratic

student answers on the way to the truth.) His exams are all problems
from the book. He might as well be drawing in the sand with a stick in
the time of Archimedes. But you can learn a lot from him if you work
hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He seems very gruff, but I've spoken with him at length in private and I
find him deeply concerned about whether students are learning the
material or not. He is particularly unhappy about the fact that the

I hate commercials and inane
content so much, and when I am working on something hard I am so lacking
in willpower, that I'd rather just not have the thing in my house. My
main watching habits these days are movies or nature documentaries on
DVD, or else recent TV episodes streamed. About half of my viewing is
done while I exercise, for distraction. For a good movie, I really
prefer to see it with a lively New York audience in a theater, but
tickets are quite expensive now (\$12/person).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I'm pissed off by Netflix's recent changes, and I'm worried that
the plan is to sell off the DVD rental, but the company is still going
to get my business. Here's the math:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DVD rental&lt;/strong&gt;. No viable commercial competitors remain to Netflix's
    DVD rental service. Blockbuster's has slower turnover even if you
    trek to the store for returns, as well as a smaller collection of
    disks on hand in my area. RedBox seems to be defunct. There are much
    smaller services in other cities, and they cost far more. The New
    York Public Library (sounds of cheering) has passable offerings at
    no cost, but they're smaller than Netflix's, there is often a very
    long wait, and disks are damaged even more often than Netflix's are.
    At two disks out per month from Netflix, I can receive and watch
    15-20 per month if I time things correctly. At \$12+tax/month,
    that's &lt;strong&gt;\$0.65-\$0.87/disk&lt;/strong&gt;. If the Post Office stops overnight
    delivery even within New York County, the cost to me will be forced
    up, but even if the cost doubles, Netflix is likely to remain the
    cheapest service for the largest selection. There is no viable
    alternative, and no streaming service offers the range of material I
    can get on disks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Streaming&lt;/strong&gt;. Currently \$8+tax/month. I generally watch only TV
    shows this way, between three and eight episodes a week, averaging
    around 20 a month, for a net cost of &lt;strong&gt;\$0.44/episode&lt;/strong&gt;. Of the
    competitors, only Amazon Prime currently comes anywhere close to
    Netflix's inventory in the areas I'm interested in, and (ignoring
    the yearly fee, which also pays shipping on books) most of the shows
    I watch would cost me \$2 or \$3/episode because they're not in the
    free-viewing category.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
So Netflix wins. Yes, I am offended by the CEO's letters. But there's no
alternative at this point. I'd only add that if the math changes, my
patronage may also change.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Longevity vs. versatility of code</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/longevity-vs-versatility-of-code.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-09-19T16:23:00-04:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2011-09-19:longevity-vs-versatility-of-code.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Until very recently, I have used HTML only as a simple markup language
for presenting static information. It was quite satisfactory for posting
announcements or writing, and easy to automate for formatting large
collections of material from my research databases. Even though the
databases might be updated daily, a given data dump was static as soon
as it was generated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I am trying to use HTML for interactive tasks, I can't avoid
facing its drawbacks any longer. One serious problem is that HTML is
"stateless" — commands take place without persistence of context, so you
either have to turn to cookies (of which many users are suspicious) or
supplement it with Javascript or other languages. Another problem is
that certain seemingly simple tasks have not been standardized (as of
HTML 4), so solutions vary by browser. An example that bothered me
recently was styling a "browse" button used for file upload. I've
identified a number of workarounds, but HTML 4 has no native way to do
this, and every workaround increases the risk of obsolescence or
outright failure in unplanned-for environments. As &lt;a href="http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/personal.html"&gt;Jukka Korpela&lt;/a&gt;
writes, ["The Browse button is particularly 'immune' to any
presentational suggestions; it's typically a 'hard-wired' part of the
browser's user interface."][] It's also dismaying how differently some
non-"web-safe" colors and background images appear when viewed in
different browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've gotten used to the incompatibilities between Python 2 and 3, which
fazed me at first. But everything connected with the web seems to be
subject to a higher margin of "not quite" than any compiled or scripting
language proper that I've seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model of longevity in traditional scholarship — the world in which I
cut my teeth — assumes that what you produce in your 20s will still be
around and basically accessible when you're in your 70s, at least.
Mathematical writings from 120 years ago are still cited with some
frequency, and I possess philological books on the order of 1000 years
old that are still basically quite usable and remain in print for that
reason. I can even make my way around 1400-year old Chinese dictionary
manuscripts without too much pain. But the amount of tweaking needed to
keep code alive is a high trade-off for what I grant is its immense
flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At bottom, I think this is a difference in economic outlook: When I work
as a scholar, I labor to produce a description of something I can show
to be true, and to present it in such a way that my thinking can be
reproduced and challenged by anyone for a very long time to come. In
exchange, I am paid essentially nothing for what I hope is intellectual
substance of quality and intrinsic worth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a different model of value involved in coding, and a different
time-frame.&lt;/p&gt;

pleasures of New York life. Not when a train is nearby, of course, but
at other times. The sounds of the street are usually gone or at least
made distant. In some stations you can hear trains in motion somewhere
else. And there are also the various sounds that human beings make —
which are much harder to hear on the street. I find subway platforms
reasonably good for reading and proofreading my writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But since the new announcement system was installed, within the past
couple of years, we have begun to be bombarded with the hyper-amplified
human voice about once a minute. It's a horror and I wonder if it was
not set in place by one of the many MTA executives who don't actually
live in New York or take the subway. Some day, something must be done
about those people — require them to commute by subway, for a start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to understand this as an intentional act, I wonder if it is not
actually a secret strategy to drive away vagrants who would otherwise
try to sleep in isolated places on the platforms.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Router VI is dead</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/router-vi-is-dead.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-09-17T23:27:00-04:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2011-09-17:router-vi-is-dead.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My sixth router this year has died — no amount of hard resetting will
revive it — it was a highly rated Asus RT-N56U, four months old. Before
that I had a series of four MediaLink MWN-WAPR150Ns — the company sent
me three replacements in succession, but none of them worked properly —
and before that I had a Linksys WRT400N that failed a week after the
warranty ran out. MediaLink worked hard to help me, and in the end I
didn't ask them for my money back. But I'm not going to try them again
soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes routers die so quickly? Is it my bad conscience, after all?
More likely, bad capacitors and air circulation. I can improve the
latter a little (open the case, leave open space under it, even aim a
low-power fan at it) but not the former. Bad capacitors even undermine
my willingness to pay for a more expensive and possibly better piece of
equipment, since I suspect the manufacturer may still be using the same
cheap parts. I swoon at the thought of a Peplink Balance, but I doubt I
can justify the cost, and for only four ports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've managed to get one computer connected directly to my modem (shields
up, Mr. Sulu) with an ethernet cable some five times as long as I am
tall. There are cables everywhere in my life now — it is beginning to
look as though I live in the movie Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worse than the cables, and worse even than the expense of buying
hardware that fails so quickly, is the waste of time as I try to track
down the problems.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Tinker Tailor remake</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/tinker-tailor-remake.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-09-15T17:30:00-04:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2011-09-15:tinker-tailor-remake.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A friend has sent me this review

makes hypothesis and counterfactual thinking more difficult, since it is
rarely marked grammatically the way it is in languages possessing a
subjective mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm unable to generalize to my own satisfaction about the question "are
Chinese speakers less able to hypothesize than speakers of other
languages?" Before hazarding opinions on the subject, I would review
cognitive measurements of people engaged in the act of
counterfactualizing, something I know has been studied. But where
language alone is concerned, my professional view as a linguistic
sinologist is that the distinctive topic-comment syntax of Chinese
merely makes it harder to &lt;em&gt;distinguish&lt;/em&gt; counterfactuals decisively from
non-counterfactuals — a counterfactual actually becomes easier to
produce but harder to recognize than if morphology were involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether all that translates to sociological conclusions is not for me to
say. I will venture, though, that the tendency of non-Chinese people to
imagine or believe unbelievable things about China and its culture must
be unequaled in the world. We may feel smug about the foolishness of
Western men caught in Chinese honey traps when we recall the cases of
Bernard Boursicot and Shí Pèipú 時佩璞 (basis of the "M. Butterfly"
story) or Katrina Leung 陳文英 and her friends in the U.S. government
(subjects of a failed spy prosecution in the Bush-Cheney era). But what
is there to laugh at, when much of the non-Chinese world also gazes on
China with eyes heavily clouded by fantasy — sometimes admiring,
sometimes hostile, but fantasy nonetheless? It seems to me that
fantasies about Chinese language and culture are common even within
Chinese society, itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps all this is the result of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;telephantasmia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
"counterfactualism at a distance" as a feature of Chinese culture - the
generation of useful fictions in observers's minds. Could &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; somehow
be related to the lack of counterfactual marking in Chinese grammar?&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>September 11th sensations</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/september-11th.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-09-11T09:21:00-04:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2011-09-11:september-11th.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I find myself &lt;strong&gt;tense&lt;/strong&gt; in the lead-up to September 11th.

New York has been &lt;strong&gt;comfortably past obsession&lt;/strong&gt; with the events
themselves for some time but America is not yet, and they will never let
us alone. Apparently there is now a special tourist memorial built at
Ground Zero and the word is it will have an expensive admission fee.
I'll consult my thesaurus but I doubt there is a word to describe how
that makes me feel. &lt;strong&gt;"Grateful for the tourist support but excluded

&lt;p&gt;The law prohibits me from passing the coin back into circulation, which
means taking the whole 25¢ loss, myself. The alternative is to allow the

seemed cooler, he said, when he was the only one who had one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I can offer three reasons why the technically inclined should not
feel their elitism to be wounded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now that there are so many smartphones everywhere, street and subway
    are much quieter overall than they were when all most people had
    were simple cellphones. That's good for me; it improves my living
    and working environment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People are also increasingly absorbed in their
    dopamine-stimulators* and therefore less likely to get in my way or
    otherwise annoy me. They move more slowly and are less likely to
    notice when I push ahead of them.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most people looking at the smartphones are listening to music,
    watching videos, playing games, or reading texts — all things that
    are much less intellect-intensive than what I use computers for. So
    there's still plenty of opportunity for techno-elitism.&lt;/li&gt;

China, after having been turned down (in an application made from
overseas) for lack of a TEFL degree. I thought my advice to this person
might be useful to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
To summarize at the outset, I think you may have better luck and a more
interesting experience if you visit China first on a tourist visa and
(rather than doing nothing but touristy things) try to make contacts
there. Don't mention the prospect of work when you apply for a visa; the
government doesn't necessarily want people coming on tourist visas to
look for work. Just choose a plausible place to visit and then plan your
own visiting time as described below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many schools — official and unofficial — as well as businesses and
private people are in sore need of competent language instruction, and
you would be much likelier to have luck getting hired by one of them if
they could meet you in person and look you over first. They may not
necessarily be able to get you a visa as a teacher, but I suspect that
is secondary to what you are looking for right now. Once you get settled
and have met enough people, you might well have more offers than you
have time to pursue, and then you could start thinking about what is
really best for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to proceed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One option is to go to a big city, hang around cafés and libraries near
expensive high schools or prestigious colleges, and meet people there
who would like a tutor and are able to pay for the service. You would
aim to build up a number of clients and you would probably give them
conversation practice or drill them on usage and idiom at their homes or
offices. You would probably find Chinese kids fun to know at first, but
in time professional people and their spouses may be more interesting
and lucrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another option is to go to a small city or county seat — where you will
learn a great deal more about the real China than in a big city — and
visit the local colleges and teaching companies and introduce yourself
to the administrators (not the English faculty, who might possibly see
you as a rival) as a willing English teacher. The administrators will
know what the hiring rules are and how to get around them if they want
you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, it will take time for you to find people who are willing to
trust you and who you can trust, so I suggest you choose a single
plausible region to visit, go there, and start networking patiently as
soon as you possibly can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese society is not based on law or due process, whatever people may
tell you, but on "face" (public prestige) and the exchange of favors and
personal contacts. As a gentleman, your word is absolutely your bond,
but other people may not feel the same way and an important part of
learning to interact with China is figuring out how to deal with that
situation — without actually making the other party look bad (a definite
no-no). So I recommend not committing yourself by contract to an
organization unless you absolutely have no other choice. Visitors who
get institutional appointments, including jobs with teaching companies,
often find themselves massively overburdened at the last minute with
extra courses that they have been "asked" to teach as a "favor" to the
institution, and I frankly do not recommend going that route unless you
really want to experience the Chinese face-and-favor system first-hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other advice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​1. Bring at least one good suit and two shirts and a good pair of shoes
— things you would not be embarrassed to wear to an Embassy dinner or to
meet an important person. Keep them clean and accessible and ready to
wear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​2. Try to get a decent name-card printed as soon as you can — something
on which you can put "[name], [degree] / [institution] / [permanent
email]" at a minimum, so that everyone who meets you has an easy way to
remember you and to reach you if they want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​3. Network, network, network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​4. Beware of experiencing culture shock. You, rather than the Chinese,
are responsible for how you handle the emotional stresses of living in
their country. You will definitely experience such stresses, no matter
where you live or who you spend time with.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>"The Highline" Park</title><link href="http://brannerchinese.github.io/website/the-highline-park.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-09-08T19:16:00-04:00</updated><author><name>David Prager Branner</name></author><id>tag:brannerchinese.github.io/website,2011-09-08:the-highline-park.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we took a couple of hours off for a visit to the

that amateur, unskilled viewers are like those who greet a large crowd
&lt;em&gt;en masse&lt;/em&gt;, whereas skilled professionals are like those who address
everyone they meet individually and in personal terms, in the sense
that the first group get an impression of the finished products which
is not precise, but only hazy, whereas professionals have the
discrimination to take each aspect of the work separately, and they
don't overlook or fail to comment on anything, whether good or bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in my opinion, we can extend the analogy to real events too: when
faced with history, lazier minds are satisfied if they gather just the
gist and the conclusion of a situation, whereas anyone who appreciates
honour and nobility, and who views the products of the master art, as
it were, of virtue, finds the details more enjoyable, on the grounds
that although the result has a lot in common with chance, yet by
virtue of their causes the particular contests of virtue against
chance occurrences and the acts of intelligent bravery in the face of
suitable conditions [become clear cases of] rationality suitably
blended with opportunity and emotion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've also attached a pair of the 5000 index cards she produced for this
project. These things are now rarely seen, I think, so they're good to
document here. Not so very long ago, the only way to find books in a
library was though a "card catalogue" — a huge collection of these
things, typed in recent decades and neatly handwritten before that,
organized and cross-referenced by title, author, major topics, and other
features. Cataloguing books — deciding how someone might want want to
find them and creating cards accordingly — was a major subprofession
among librarians, and my mother has a degree in it from Columbia's
defunct Library School.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can imagine, the contents of this pair of cards have been copied
and recopied over and over again as the material has grown fuller and
more complete. The "xx" notations at the bottom of each card are for
tracking cross-references to "literacy" that appear in other
entries.[&lt;img alt="" src="http://brannerchinese.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/ecs-literacy-project-two-of-spbs-index-cards-2011061.jpg" title="ECS literacy project - two of SPB's index cards 201106" /&gt;][]I used \$latex \LaTeX\$ and other tools to produce
camera-ready copy for the publisher. With heavy editing, the index
shrank from an initial 100 pages to the final 44 that are appearing in

&lt;p&gt;[ If we look into the matter closely, our pleasures are made up of the
difficulty of enjoyment, deprivation of it, and desire for it. All of
these are to be found in the act of fast-breaking. I saw two of my

when, on Easter Sunday, they saw the first cut into a ham or the
evisceration of a block of paté from its mold. Now — degenerate race

education requirements&lt;/a&gt; each college has. No one is measuring&lt;/p&gt;

of American academia, and Elliott describes it as "bracing and darkly
pleasurable."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Elliot remarks,

&gt; Forty years ago professors themselves managed university affairs,
&gt; often spending limited stints in administration as a professional
&gt; obligation before returning to teaching and research. But as
&gt; professional administrators have proliferated, professors, having
&gt; little stomach for endless committee meetings and inane business
&gt; ajrgon, have been happy to give up their managerial responsibilities.
&gt; … As a result, however, professors have sacrificed much of their
&gt; influence over their own institutions.
&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
I don't know if there was ever a time when professors did not complain
about their institutions or the state of academia generally, but the
topic is now quite a popular one.&lt;/p&gt;

Romance languages, with a meager population of some 60,000 speakers
(&lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903352704576540252076676760.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;, 1 September, 2011, p. A10&lt;/a&gt;). It is native to
Val Müstair (Münstertal) at the far eastern edge of the Swiss Alps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As has happened in so many other places, a political effort to protect
the language has led to the creation of an official standard that no one
speaks natively and that is now in conflict with the living dialects.
Children are confronted with the constructed official standard (Romansh
Grischun or RG) in school and a different native dialect at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the article deals with a movement to oppose RG. The article ends
with a linguist quoting some speakers as saying "If they're going to
take away my mother tongue, I'd just as soon speak German."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
W. D. Elcock's &lt;em&gt;Romance Languages&lt;/em&gt; (London: Faber &amp;amp; Faber Limited,
1960), 478–81, says:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a language [Romansh] profited from the general increase in literacy
and tended to become the object of a patriotic cult, symbolic of local
autonomy. This tendency came to a head in 1938, when the inhabitants,
alarmed by the extravagant territorial claims of Fascist Italy, backed
by the gratuitous assertion that [Romansh] is an Italian dialect,
successfully brought pressure on the Federal Government to secure its
recognition as the fourth national language of Switzerland.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elcock goes on to describe two competing standards, one each for two
towns with majority Catholic or Protestant populations, respectively.
Elcock adds that the Protestant standard is (was?) more conservative, as
it has been connected with printed religious literature since the
sixteenth century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Val Müstair's dialect is made to sound very parochial and isolated in
Elcock's book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In 1970, Rebecca Posner says,  &lt;/p&gt;

Briefly:

&gt; The new book … is very much unlike other introductory \$latex

&gt; this. … Despite its flaws, this is an interesting book. It covers many
&gt; useful topics not covered elsewhere, it is well written and is
&gt; understandable for a novice. This book can be [the] basis of a crash

&lt;p&gt;[Johnson] recommended to me to keep a journal of my life, full and
unreserved. He said it would be a very good exercise, and would yield
me great satisfaction when the particulars were faded from my
remembrance. … He counselled me to keep it private, and said I might
surely have a friend who would burn it in case of my death. [14 July,
1763]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He told me, that he had twelve or fourteen times attempted to keep a
journal of his life, but never could persevere. He advised me to do
it. &lt;strong&gt;'The great thing to be recorded&lt;/strong&gt;, (said he,) &lt;strong&gt;is the state of
your own mind&lt;/strong&gt;; and you should write down every thing that you
remember, for you cannot judge at first what is good or bad; and write
immediately while the impression is fresh, for it will not be the same
a week afterwards.' [11 April, 1773]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, objects provide only a modest benefit: perhaps a 20 to
30 percent improvement in productivity but certainly not a factor of
two, let alone a factor of 10. … OO programming does not provide a
large improvement in productivity because it neither raises the level
of programming nor encourages reuse. … The strong typing of most OO
languages encourages narrowly defined packages that are hard to reuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… Another problem with OO languages is their emphasis on inheritance.
Implementation inheritance, in which one class borrows code that was
written for another class, is a bad idea that makes software harder to
manage and reuse. … [It] causes the same intertwining and brittleness
that have been observed when &lt;code&gt;goto&lt;/code&gt; statements are overused. As a
result, OO systems often suffer from complexity and lack of reuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scripting languages, on the other hand, have actually generated
significant software reuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… Nonetheless OO programming does provide at least two useful
features. The first is encapsulation: objects combine data and code in
a way that hides implementation details. This makes it easier to
manage large systems. The second useful feature is interface
inheritance, where classes provide the same methods and application
programming interfaces (APIs) even though they have different
implementations. This makes the classes interchangeable and encourages
reuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the benefits of objects can be achieved in scripting
languages as well as system programming languages … for example,
Python is an OO scripting language.&lt;/p&gt;

of dried turmeric powder. It smells not unlike an infusion of the
familiar powder but has a much richer and somewhat carrot-like favor,
some pepperiness, and a sweetness that emerges faster and more intensely
than when turmeric powder is steeped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I steep the shreds of one medium-sized root (c. 12 g) in a large (c. 900
cc) teapotful of just-boiled water, and find it quite palatable after 20
minutes. No milk or sweeteners are needed (these feature in South Asian
preparations of &lt;em&gt;haldi chai&lt;/em&gt; as a treatment for colds).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beware of staining your hands, clothes, and everything in your kitchen
yellow. (Staining your soul with turmeric is acceptable, however.) To
get rid of stains on kitchen equipment I use Soft Scrub, a harsh
cleanser that contains bleach, grit, and a number of other substances.
That will quickly remove the sticky yellow stains from countertops,
plates, and blades. Wash everything thoroughly after you're finished
with Soft Scrub, to get rid of its own residues. (The ingredients are
currently listed at
&lt;a href="http://www.softscrub.com/Soft-Scrub-With-Beach-Cleanser"&gt;http://www.softscrub.com/Soft-Scrub-With-Beach-Cleanser&lt;/a&gt; .) Soft Scrub
reacts with the turmeric to produce a dark red/brown color, and you may
at first imagine you've cut yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know how to get the yellow stains off my fingers, so I use
inexpensive rubber gloves to hold the turmeric root while I'm shredding
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Fresh turmeric apparently has anti-fungal properties,&lt;/strong&gt; and the fresh
roots do not quickly go bad if kept in the refrigerator in a sealed
plastic bag and a paper towel to absorb moisture. If an infusion made
from the fresh root is left out overnight. it is totally without
cloudiness the next morning. (The same is true of rooibos tea.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The Chinese name&lt;/strong&gt; for turmeric root is &lt;em&gt;yùjīn&lt;/em&gt; 鬱金 lit. 'verdant
gold'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ms. Reid vividly describes how people tried to get by on virtually
inedible food substitutes: cotton-seed cakes that were normally used
as fuel in ship furnaces; sheep guts, together with calf skins from a
tannery, were turned into "meat jelly"; fermented birch sawdust was
turned into "yeast extract," which, dissolved in hot water, was
considered "yeast soup." As the civilians grew more desperate, they
scraped dry glue from the underside of wallpaper, boiled leather shoes
and belts hoping in vain that they could be eaten or at least chewed.
"Zoologists survived the siege: they knew how to catch rats and
pigeons," the author notes. "Impractical mathematicians died."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most desperate turned to cannibalism. Using police records that
became available in 2004, Ms. Reid provides details where Salisbury
had to rely on unofficial and often unsubstantiated anecdotes. The
stories are gruesome. It was common for bodies to be left in
apartments among the living because of the danger of taking them to
cemeteries or even down to the street. Those that were buried were dug
up and eaten. Hospital workers took home amputated limbs. Organized
groups lured passersby into apartments with offers to barter food for
valuables, then murdered the visitors and ate them. According to
police records, there were more than 2,000 arrests for cannibalism in
Leningrad, a figure that would have to be considered well below the
true number of actual episodes.&lt;/p&gt;
