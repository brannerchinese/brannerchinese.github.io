		<div><p>A friend sent me a link to <a href="http://paulgraham.com/property.html">Paul Graham's recounting of the old story</a>
of the poor student who enjoyed the smell of fish cooking in the
restaurant next door, and who was sued by the restaurant-owner, who
claimed the student was stealing the smell of his food. Graham uses the
story to suggest that intellectual property rights are subject to an
evolving definition and implies (though he doesn't say it in so many
words) that they are evanescent.</p>
<p>But this is a poor analogy.</p>
<p>The owner of the shop is not selling smells; he is selling food and the
smells escape freely from it, the same as from the food other people
sell. He does not usually charge for smells or even, under normal
circumstances, treat them as a commodity. There is no comparison to
intellectual property (except perhaps to people who can't tell the
difference between creative work and the smell of cooked fish).</p>
<p>A better analogy would be if I bought your products and offered them as
free gifts for new customers at my bank. I have the right to do that
since I've paid for them. But I can't pretend that there is no condition
to be met in order to receive a gift, and I would be insincere if I said
my entire goal was to distribute your products. But that is exactly what
the advertising industry does by using Internet search results as a lure
to expose us to targeted ads and subject us to data-mining. It is still
possible to avoid the ads — you can use tools like <a href="http://brannerchinese.wordpress.com/2012/02/06/adblock-plus-is-the-most-useful-piece-of-shareware-ive-ever-had/" title="Adblock Plus is the most useful piece of shareware I’ve ever had">Adblock Plus</a> and
you can conduct all your web-searches through a browser that doesn't
link searches to a known login (I like <a href="http://www.icab.de/dl.php">iCab</a> for this purpose, while
logged into accounts on more mainstream browsers).</p>
<p>Graham's post is primarily about "labels and studios", the high end of
the entertainment business, which are a primary force behind the
perpetual extension of copyright in the United States, the fictitious
electronic security that is an increasing drag on our economy, and
recent legal threats to end the freedom of the Internet. "Labels and
studios" are easy to vilify. But the idea of intellectual property
doesn't belong to them, and not everyone who owns intellectual property
is guilty of their excesses.</p>
<p>To pretend otherwise is disingenuous and provides tacit support to the
huge, powerful technology/advertising companies that now treat the
entire content of the Internet as a resource with which to make money.</p>
<p><a href="http://brannerchinese.com/dpb/publications.html">I make all my work freely available on the internet</a>, but it remains
copyright and its use is not free in the sense "unencumbered", even
though it is free in the sense "freely accessible" and may be copied at
will for individual reading and study. There's a clear statement of this
principle on the site. My feeling is that if you use my stuff to make
money, you owe me a cut.</p></div>
