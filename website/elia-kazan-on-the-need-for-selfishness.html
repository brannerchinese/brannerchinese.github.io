		<div><p>One of the recurring ideas in Elia Kazan's memoirs is that success
requires passion and passion requires selfishness. Below are a few
extracts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I hear the phrase "master class," I want to vomit. Today when I'm
consulted by an eager newcomer about whom to "go to for help," I
generally answer that I can't offer advice unless and until I know
more about him — which I make damned sure I don't have time to do. …
Yes, the experience of other actors and directors can be communicated
and does help, but on the whole it's better for a young actor, driven
by a strong desire, to stumble, fall, pick up, come on again, to find
his way. (p. 142)</p>
<hr />
<p>I remembered an old saying, "Anyone who cannot feel <em>passionate</em> love
for women, flowers, or wine or for the work he is doing, anyone who is
not in some way <em>un</em>reasonable and <em>un</em>balanced, will never, never
have any talent for literature. (p. 215)</p>
<hr />
<p>I believe every artist is, as he has to be, arrogant. You may not go
along with that; the word has unfortunate connotations. But whatever
else an artist may be saying in his work, he is certainly saying "I'm
important!"</p>
<p>Arrogance, when it's depicted on the screen or stage, is usually
projected by boisterous behavior. Not so in life. The most arrogant
people I've known — people whom I admire for this quality as well as
for the work they do — are often quiet with the special ease that
comes from being sure of themselves.</p>
<p>Artists are different from other people, and they do behave
differently. I've already expressed my opinion that vanity — one of
the seven deadly sins — is often a spur to creation in a filmmaker.
Now consider the seven deadly virtues for the artist. Here are seven:
Agreeable. Accommodating. Fair-minded. Well balanced. Obliging.
Generous. Democratic. You don't agree with my choices? How about
these: Controlled. Kind. Unprejudiced. Yielding. Unassertive.
Faithful. Self-effacing. And for good measure: Cooperative. They are
all deadly — for the artist. They add up to what is suggested by "nice
guy," "sweet," "pleasant," "lovable," "on the side of the angels."
None of which any artist is, should be, or ever has been. If he seems
that way, he is concealing his true nature. He should better be a
disrupter, on the side of the devil. (p. 299)</p>
<hr />
<p>[Three qualities] necessary for a man working in the arts: vain,
arrogant, and unyielding. (p. 301)</p>
<hr />
<p>The great theatre works I'd heard tell about and read about were
finally the product of a single artist, an individual who was his own
man, a visionary with a special vision and a dominating ego. It has
always been thus and always would be. I knew that very well know. I
knew that dependence on, or collaboration with, even a man I respected
as much as I did [Director] Harold [Clurman] was not good. (p. 322)</p>
<hr />
<p>[Quoting John Steinbeck:]</p>
<p>Get mean. Get selfish. Be yourself. Find out who you are — it's the
only creative source you have. Determine what you want and don't stand
still for anything else. Find out what your place in the world is and
claim it for your own and don't let anyone take it away. (p. 594)</p>
<hr />
<p>[Composer Manos Hadjidakis] had the most overwhelming joy in working
and in his work; it was easy for him, and once he started, he was like
all the other geniuses I've known, a compulsive hard worker. He'd
earned his success the hard way. The old saying that genius is ten
percent inspiration and ninety percent perspiration underestimates the
importance of relentless effort. But work doesn't describe what these
men do. There is a blacking out of everything else in their lives;
it's all secondary — love, greed, pleasure, family. The work
experience is what they want from life. They don't know how to
"unwind," nor do they want to. (p. 658)</p>
