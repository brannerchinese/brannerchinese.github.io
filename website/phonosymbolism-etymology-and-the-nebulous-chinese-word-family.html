		<div><p>In Chinese, virtually no derivational morphology is now productive and
it is unclear to what extent it was active even in antiquity. Now,
morphology is a central tool of etymology in those languages that have
it. In its absence, in Chinese, one of the principles of etymology is
that phonologically similar words of similar meaning may be placed
together and called a "word family" (<em>tóngyuán yǔzú</em> 同源語族). I have
discussed some of the issues surrounding early Chinese morphology and
word families in two papers (Branner 2002, 2003 in the references at the
bottom of this post). Victor Mair has just mentioned this issue in a
criticism of William Rozycki's 1997 essay on "phonosymbolism" and I am
moved to comment here.</p>
<p>The thing Rozycki calls "phonosymbolism" (or sound symbolism) is related
to <em>synesthesia</em> (stimulation of one kind of sense-impression by
another) and other rhetorical concepts. The key idea that connects all
of them to the Chinese "word family" is that they enable us to reduce
the number of distinct morphemes in the inventory of a language. When I
try to do this — sift down the number of morphemes — in real language
materials, two worries come immediately to mind:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exclusion</strong>. English words that seem to belong to Rozycki's "kap"
    group (meaning 'to take' etc. etc. etc.) are easy to think of:
    <em>have</em>, <em>cop</em>, <em>grab</em>, … . On what principles am I to say that a
    word does <em>not</em> belong to a certain group? Formally, if we have a
    rule for inclusion, we also need one for exclusion.</li>
<li><strong>Systemic order</strong>. If you go through all the morphemes and corral
    together those that seem to belong to substantial groups, you find
    there are still large numbers that belong to no group. With labor,
    you may be able to create smaller groups — groups of two or three or
    four members — but even then there will be a huge residue of
    morphemes that don't fit comfortably into any group. What is
    accomplished by establishing word families is a reduction in the
    total number of recognized morphemes. The formal question is, after
    we have done that and a huge list of isolated morphemes inevitably
    still remains, just how much have we increased the overall orderly
    state of the system of the language?</li>
</ul>
<p>A third worry also emerges if you put aside dictionaries and do not try
to work on the inventory of a "whole" standard language, as documented
from multiple sources:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Artificial enrichment from written sources</strong>. In oral languages
    known to one speaker or a small community of them and documented in
    great detail through linguistic fieldwork, you find that the number
    of semantically redundant morphemes — including exact synonyms as
    well as those connected more imprecisely by phonosymbolic or word
    family relations — drops to almost none. It is not that people do
    not know all those other words, but the inventory or morphemes they
    prefer to use in speech is generally quite restricted. Formally
    speaking, on examination much phonosymbolic and word family
    variation seems to be an artefact of the written documentation of a
    language, whose scope generally exceeds the scope in active use by
    individuals and small communities of speakers. Is it meaningful for
    us to define the scope of a language in terms of our own convenience
    in hunting for cognate forms?</li>
</ul>
<p>This idea was developed in Branner 2010 on Chinese secret languages,
documented from original materials collected in fieldwork.
Phonosymbolism through productive morphology, of course, is a separate
matter because it does not affect the number of morphemes in the
inventory.</p>
