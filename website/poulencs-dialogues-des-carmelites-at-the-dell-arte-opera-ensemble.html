		<div><p>We are just back from the opening night of [Poulenc's <em>Dialogues des
Carmélites</em> at the Dell' Arte Opera Ensemble][], in a 250-seat
performance space on 13th Street and Third Avenue.</p>
<p>The Dell' Arte trains young singers who are trying to make the jump
between academic training and stage careers. These days they have
performances only in the second half of August each year. There are two
more shows to go and I recommend this one highly; we're going to try
their <em>Carmen</em> shortly, too, but <em>Carmélites</em> is staged less often and
although I can't speak to the <em>Carmen</em> just yet, knowing what I know
tonight I'd recommend seeing <em>Carmélites</em>. All five of the principal
female roles were very well cast, and while there were a couple of very
minor mishaps — in the orchestra and English supertitles — the show was
memorably impressive and a steal at \$30 for a regular ticket.</p>
<hr />
<p>The theatre, the East Thirteenth Street Theatre, is busier as the home
of the <a href="http://www.classicstage.org/">Classic Stage Company (CSC)</a>. The space is a good one — nicely
laid out and acoustically satisfactory. I was raised in the big concert
and opera houses of this city — and the big museums and parks, too — and
of that sort of thing I have had enough for a lifetime. For my money, it
is much better to experience creative work of all kinds in a venue of
proper, I mean human, proportions.</p>
<p>That reminds me of a comment of Elia Kazan (1909–2003) about Lincoln
Center, where he and a friend were involved in the original planning of
the Vivian Beaumont Theatre:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A building of any kind expresses not only the requirements and perhaps
the character of a client but also the architect's feelings about the
culture of his day. … Lincoln Center with its opulence reflects the
tastes and ideals of the kind of upper-middle-class person who goes to
the opening of the opera each fall dressed in the costume head-waiters
wear. The two Chagalls hang like trophies in the opera house, their
details out of all scale with the place. "America can buy the best!"
might be the motto there. "Culture is good business!" is also being
promoted. We hoped there would be a contrast between the
pretentiousness of the outside of our building and what was offered
within. … We wanted a stage that would help impel us to braver work by
its design and its placement in relation to the audience.</p>
<p>[Kazan eventually left the project.] … What we'd planned so carefully
and worked on for so long was passed on to others, who couldn't help
being bewildered by what we'd handed down. … The story of our building
is the story of Lincoln Center, an art administrated by real estate
operators and bankers who demand, not effort in a new direction, but
reliable returns on an investment and proof against costs, and who
have neither the patience nor the money to give to people who might be
trying to create a new kind of theatre, nor the time they need to find
their way.</p>
<p>The exterior of the Vivian Beaumont when I walk past it now reminds me
of the tomb of a Japanese emperor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From Elia Kazan, <em>A Life</em>, [N.p.: Da Capo Press, 1997], pp. 612–14.</p>
<p>I'm glad to say there were no imperial tombs suggested by any part of
tonight's performance.</p>
