		<div><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Portmanteau here refers to an unusual type of Chinese
character: a composite of two or more graphs for living words, all of
which are to be read (in order) to give the meaning of the word
represented by the whole character. It is something different from the
conventional notion of the “ideograph” or <em>huìyìzì</em> 會意字, the
juxtaposition of graphs representing ideas or objects that contribute
abstractly to the overall meaning of the word represented. I have shown
elsewhere that characters are read through a process of recognition
rather than decipherment, arguing that “complex pictograph” is a better
description of the “motivation” (basis of character structure) of many
graphs traditionally considered <em>huìyì</em> (Branner 2009). But the
portmanteau is a different case. Its components are not abstract;
understanding its structure depends on actually reading these components
as connected words to form a phrase that defines or denotes the word.</p>
</p>

<p>This paper reviews a number of portmanteaux in current use and considers
their place in Chinese grammatology. Such characters are of course part
of the history of cursive Chinese and seem to have begun to be discussed
rather late in the received history of Chinese writing, around the sixth
century c.e.; it is doubtful that they could be strictly the same as the
<em>huìyì</em> mentioned in the first-century <em>Shuōwén jiězì</em> 說文解字.</p>
</p>

<p>In terms of their structure and their relationship to oral words,
portmanteaux embody a conception different from most mainstream
characters. Their construction is more self-conscious than other
character-types, which suggests that they are a later development. Their
relationship to oral words is tenuous and tends to change frequently.</p>
