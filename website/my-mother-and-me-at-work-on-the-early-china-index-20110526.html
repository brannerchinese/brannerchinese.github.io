		<div><p>This summer my mother and I finished indexing a book that Li Feng and I
have been working on since 2005, <a href="http://www.washington.edu/uwpress/search/books/LIWRIT.html"><em>Reading and Literacy in Early
China</em></a>. My mother worked on it continuously for six months; I helped
her on and off but then worked on it continuously for the final six
weeks.</p>
<p>Below is a picture of us in the heat of labor in late May.[<img alt="" src="http://brannerchinese.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dpb-and-spb-at-work-on-the-index-to-the-ecs-literacy-book-201105261.jpg" title="DPB and SPB at work on the index to the ECS literacy book, 20110526" />][]</p>
<p>I've also attached a pair of the 5000 index cards she produced for this
project. These things are now rarely seen, I think, so they're good to
document here. Not so very long ago, the only way to find books in a
library was though a "card catalogue" — a huge collection of these
things, typed in recent decades and neatly handwritten before that,
organized and cross-referenced by title, author, major topics, and other
features. Cataloguing books — deciding how someone might want want to
find them and creating cards accordingly — was a major subprofession
among librarians, and my mother has a degree in it from Columbia's
defunct Library School.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, the contents of this pair of cards have been copied
and recopied over and over again as the material has grown fuller and
more complete. The "xx" notations at the bottom of each card are for
tracking cross-references to "literacy" that appear in other
entries.[<img alt="" src="http://brannerchinese.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/ecs-literacy-project-two-of-spbs-index-cards-2011061.jpg" title="ECS literacy project - two of SPB's index cards 201106" />][]I used \$latex \LaTeX\$ and other tools to produce
camera-ready copy for the publisher. With heavy editing, the index
shrank from an initial 100 pages to the final 44 that are appearing in
the book. Alas, much useful information had to be deleted in the
process.</p>
