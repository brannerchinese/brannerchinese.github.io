		<div><p>I'm starting my second month at <a href="http://hackerschool.com" title="Hacker School">Hacker School</a>, a sort of ripening
cave for cheeses of the programmer variety.</p>
<p>I'm hard put to sum up the experience in a few words, but I will say
that it has been the most intense episode of independent learning I have
had since my first year of fieldwork in China. (I found myself in the
mountains of Western Fújiàn without supervision and learned how to do
linguistic fieldwork by myself with real Chinese farmers and working
people in their own environment.) "Independent learning" does no justice
to it, though, because while I spend most of the day under my own
direction, in one respect it is as though I am in an apprenticeship —
albeit one whose terms are constantly shifting. There is a huge range of
knowledge among the 44 or so members of the current "batch", and I can
easily get advice or instruction on almost anything I have trouble with.</p>
<p>More useful than advice or instruction, however, is constructive
prodding. Hacker School has a system for encouraging that, called
pairing. Pairing is when two people work "together" — on a single
computer, with only one person at the keyboard, but both involved in the
coding or whatever is being done. There is an element of dialectic,
negotiation, Talmudic disputation, or call it what you like from among
the familiar models of this kind.</p>
<p>On our first day, a month ago, Nick Bergson-Shilcock spoke to us about
philosophy, and among his points was that “pairing” is the thing that
members of past batches most often say they wish they had done but
didn’t, or didn’t until too late. I'm feverishly self-directed by
temperament, and there were projects I knew I wanted to do, and to
conceptualize on my own. So I didn't exactly see how I would find a
comfortable way to start pairing. But it was "easiest" just to jump into
it rather than worrying about being comfortable. I've now had about half
a dozen pairing experiences and am fully sold on its utility. And on its
comfort, too — it's quite pleasurable, and the learning that happens in
the encounter extends deeper into my mind than if I pursue self-absorbed
work alone.</p>
<p>I am confident I can learn anything, but the one thing I really lack is
experience. Yesterday I "apprenticed" myself to a far more proficient
programmer, volunteering to write two web applications for his use, to
save him some time in a project. In the end he substantially rewrote my
code, and for me that was a great gift — a chance to see a more expert
solution to a problem I had attempted, and to observe any number of
efficiencies and best practices.</p>
<p>Night sends me to bed tired but full of unspent emotional energy; in the
morning I find I have usually only had four or six hours of sleep but
have trouble restraining my drive to get back to work.</p></div>
