		<div><p>The Dutch publishing house Brill has issued its own eponymous typeface,
which it describes this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This indispensable tool for scholars will become freely available
later this year for non-commercial use. You will be able to download
the font package after agreeing to the End User License Agreement.
(<a href="http://www.brill.nl/news/brill-typeface">brill.nl/news/brill-typeface</a>, accessed 20120205)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The document displaying the font, v. 1.0, is currently posted at
[brill.nl/files/brill.nl/brill_typeface_user_guide_1.00.pdf][].</p>
<p>As it happens, Google also supplies fonts — a vast range of them — over
400 as of this morning. They are illustrated at <a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts">google.com/webfonts</a>
and a showcase of some of them in plausibly familiar applications has
appeared on the website of a <a href="http://hellohappy.org">designer, Chad Mazzola</a>:
<a href="http://hellohappy.org/beautiful-web-type/">hellohappy.org/beautiful-web-type/</a>.</p>
<p>What most interests me is the different terms of licensing. Brill's
license is proprietary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Commercial use of any kind, including the embedding of the fonts or
part(s) of them in any Commercial Product not published by BRILL is
prohibited unless prior written permission has been secured from
BRILL; write to brill-typeface-commercial-license@brill.nl should you
want to acquire such a permission. None of these fonts may be
redistributed to others, nor may they be sold, without prior written
consent from BRILL.
(<a href="http://www.brill.nl/promotions/brill-fonts-end-user-license-agreement">www.brill.nl/promotions/brill-fonts-end-user-license-agreement</a>,
accessed 20120205)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Google, however, has turned to the generous SIL Open Font License (OFL),
established by the <a href="http://sil.org/sil/">Summer Institute of Linguistics</a>, an American
organization of Christian missionary linguists. The OFL is modeled on
familiar "free/libre" licences for other software products, and
specifies at least two points worth reading about thinking about:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"the freedom to use font software for any purpose" (dpb: in other
words, use in the commercial products kiboshed by Brill are explicitly
permitted)</p>
<p>"We also hope that this new license will fill a need for lesser-known
languages, complex scripts and typographic needs with low direct
economic value and so empower language communities who were left out
by proprietary vendors until now."

To say it in a few words, Google offers a library of free fonts,
supported by its immense targeted advertising business. Brill, noted for
its expensive reference works, is operating more like a traditional type
foundry in seeking to control the use of its (single) product.</p>
<p>Conventional wisdom, or anyway the opinion of many who are giving their
opinion these days, is that Google's model will soon replace Brill's.
Physical books and DVDs will disappear just as the typewriter did, I am
told. But I'm inclined to think the models will coexist for the long
term, and that proprietary works and tools will continue to survive
among those freely distributed ones whose financial support is less
transparent.</p>
<p>I think that technology has enabled the functions of different works and
tools to become much more specialized than they once were, and that is a
prescription for coexistence and coevolution. Think of the variety of
mainstream vehicles that now exist for transmitting a performance: audio
recording, radio, film, television, streaming, podcast — all very
substantial industries that show no sign of disappearing. People still
flock to live performances, too. It's true that the oldest of these
vehicles has not yet been around for 120 years, and in another 120
almost anything might happen.</p>
<p>To that I say: Google's unrestricted free distribution of tools and
services is supported by a business model that has changed considerably
in the decade and a half since the company was incorporated, and by the
sale of a service that many people feel qualms about even though they
genuinely like the tools and services and are happy not to have to pay
for them. It is hard to be sanguine about the long-term evolutionary
fitness of that model. In particular, I can't see it remaining
completely unrestricted. I predict that Google will gradually impose
more conditions on how users commit themselves to the company and make
their personal information available. I also suspect that governments
will be unable to resist the temptation to tax or regulate those
services. I don't see this game as anywhere near over.</p>
<p>There is no question, however, that Google's model has fulfilled the
traditional function of capitalist innovation, in decimating many
businesses operating on a settled, proprietary model from an earlier
time.</p></div>
