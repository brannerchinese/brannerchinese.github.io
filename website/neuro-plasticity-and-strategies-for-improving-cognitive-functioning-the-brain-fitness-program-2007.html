		<div><p>The PBS documentary "The Brain Fitness Program", from the year 2007,
describes conclusions from the past several decades about
neuro-plasticity — the ability of the brain to reorganize itself and
improve its functioning and efficiency. The main researcher whose
research is highlighted is the psychologist Donald O. Hebb (1904–85),
and there is also material about the rehabilitation clinic of Dr. Edward
Taub. The documentary consists in large part of interview snippets with
the neuroscientists William Jagust, Arthur Toga, Michael Merzenich,
Jason Karlawish, and the authors Sharon Begley, Shannon Moffett, and
Norman Doige, interspersed with animations and other illustrations.</p>
<p>The documentary is suitable for general viewers although it seems to be
directed especially at older people concerned about avoiding cognitive
impairment. To speak harshly, I found it motivational at the expense of
concrete documentation. But it was interesting and there were two
summary lists at the end that were relatively useful:</p>
<p><strong>"Tenets"</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Time 44:03</em>. "Change can occur only when the brain is in the mood."
    Paying attention and being alert and ready for action.</li>
<li><em>45:03</em>. "Change strengthens connection between neurons engaged at
    the same time." Trying something repeatedly allows the brain to
    selectively remember the most effective combinations of small
    variables contributing to the more effective tries.</li>
<li><em>46:02</em>. "Neurons that fire together wire together." Much of the
    brain's functioning involves prediction, and the brain improves its
    ability to predict based on observation of things that reliably
    occur in series.</li>
<li><em>47:45</em>. "Initial changes are just temporary." The possibility of
    changing the brain's structure increases when activities are
    repeated over time.</li>
<li><em>48:41</em>. "Brain plasticity is a two-way street and we can either
    drive brain change positively or negatively." Malleability can mean
    vulnerability, as well as the flexibility to change. Persistent bad
    habits and environmental interference are examples of negative
    effects.</li>
<li><em>49:52</em>. "Memory is crucial for learning." The brain maintains a
    model in memory of what it is trying to do and evaluates the results
    of repeated attempts to meet that model.</li>
<li><em>50:54</em>. "Motivation is a key factor in brain plasticity."
    Acquisition of new skills is the primary means for developing the
    adult brain.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<strong>"Tips for optimal plasticity"</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>55:30</em>. "You need your heart to be decent shape."</li>
<li><em>55:40</em>. "Training should be incremental."</li>
<li><em>55:45</em>. "Training needs to be taxing and systematically improving."</li>
<li><em>55:57</em>. "It should be interesting to engage the motivation circuits
    in your brain."</li>
</ul>

produced by Lennlee Keep. Santa Fé Productions, Inc., 2007. About 58
minutes; the DVD contains a number of interesting outtake scenes, as
well.)</p></div>
