		<div><p>I find myself <strong>tense</strong> in the lead-up to September 11th. I feel most of
New York has been <strong>comfortably past obsession</strong> with the events
themselves for some time but America is not yet, and they will never let
us alone. Apparently there is now a special tourist memorial built at
Ground Zero and the word is it will have an expensive admission fee.
I'll consult my thesaurus but I doubt there is a word to describe how
that makes me feel. <strong>"Grateful for the tourist support but excluded
from regular involvement"</strong> — on second thought, this is already a known
feeling in New York. As to the way we were <strong>manipulated</strong> with terror
"alerts" during the Bush-Cheney years, the less said the better.</p>
<p>I have <strong>never gotten comfortable with the name</strong> "9/11", which seemed
to dominate media coverage of the aftermath of the attacks. However, on
the ground in New York in those days, "September 11th" was the main name
I heard used; being without a TV I use it still.</p>
<p>I have been <strong>dismayed at the complications</strong> that overtook the
rebuilding of the World Trade Center — I had expected that to be done
very rapidly, as a show of stamina and drive.</p></div>
