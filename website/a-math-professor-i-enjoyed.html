		<div><p>I want to describe one of the professors I know at the Grove School of
Engineering at the City College of New York.</p>
<p>This man, in his sixties, teaches math-heavy courses in the Computer
Science department. His course descriptions still mention Fortran,
though I think he teaches mainly in C and C++. But mentioning Fortran is
good for producing a certain effect, and my guess is he desires that
effect. He doesn't hold with electronic bulletin boards and just hands
out a multi-generationally photocopied one-page syllabus with the
current year's changes marked in pen. It is usually not straight on the
page. His lectures are mostly proofs, which he delivers looking
alternately at the board or at a corner of the ceiling at the back of
the room — though he does engage occasionally in a sort of Socratic
baiting of students. ("What is an 'even number'?" Then shoot down all
student answers on the way to the truth.) His exams are all problems
from the book. He might as well be drawing in the sand with a stick in
the time of Archimedes. But you can learn a lot from him if you work
hard.</p>
<p>He seems very gruff, but I've spoken with him at length in private and I
find him deeply concerned about whether students are learning the
material or not. He is particularly unhappy about the fact that the
distribution of student grades is bimodal — it is hard to "teach to the
middle", he says, when there is none.</p></div>
