		<div><p>During my main period of fieldwork in the Chinese countryside (1992â€“96,
2004-06), I had trouble with ballpoint pens, which often got clogged by
the relatively rough copy paper I printed my surveys on. I tried
fountain pens but the Chinese ink was not waterproof, and field notes
may come into contact with rain, tea, river water, or Heaven knows what
else at any moment, so it's best to use a waterproof or even archival
ink.</p>
<p>I eventually switched to an inexpensive model of Rapidograph, which I
bought in the US during a short visit in 1994. The fineness of the point
was very helpful for the work, although I had periodic problems with
clogging. Later, I discovered the Staedtler Mars marker pens, which have
replaceable cartridges. I used those for a number of years.</p>
<p>Late in my fieldworking life, I began using Sakura Pigma Micron pens.
Like the Mars, Microns are basically very fine markers, rather than true
technical pens. But they tend not to become blunted or to dry out
quickly, and there is no problem about refilling them or replacing a
cartridge. Their ink is archival quality, which means it is indelible
and pH-neutral. As long as you keep a spare handy, your fieldwork can
proceed smoothly and your notes should remain legible for a long time.</p>
<p>I now use a computer for almost all writing and note-taking tasks, but I
still carry Micron pens with me everywhere. There are several
inexpensive sources for them in New York and on line.</p></div>
