		<div><p>For studying calculus, doing problem sets is the main thing, until the
process becomes more or less mechanical. You can do that on your own for
the most part.</p>
<p>If you crave understanding, however, you cannot find better on-line
lectures than those of Prof. Herbert Gross.</p>
<p>Prof. Gross taught mathematics at MIT and Bunker Hill Community College
for a lifetime, and around 1970 he prepared a series of videos â€” the
clearest instructional films I can remember seeing.</p>
<p>The main series, "Calculus Revisited", is part of <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-006-calculus-revisited-fall-2010/">MIT
OpenCourseWare</a>. The multivariable calculus videos are not included
there yet, however, so has posted them himself on his own website:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.adjectivenounmath.com/id93.html">Part 2: http://www.adjectivenounmath.com/id93.html</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.adjectivenounmath.com/id98.html">Part 3: http://www.adjectivenounmath.com/id98.html</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that there are extensive paper (PDF) materials intended to
supplement the videos.</p>
<p>Prof. Gross's videos are far and away the best of their kind that I have
seen, and never mind that they're vintage 1969 and black and white.
(Calculus itself dates from around 1660-1860 and the era of ink and
quill.)</p>
<p>I contacted Herb Gross earlier this year and asked him about the origins
of his project. He told me that he developed this curriculum over about
three years with Harold Mickley, the director of the Center for Advanced
Engineering Study (CAES) at MIT. It was intended for industry. Gross and
Mickley went over the lecture plans in detail to ensure that everything
was as clear as possible. No cue cards (the predecessor of the
teleprompter) were used, since the blackboard content was written out in
advance and provided a running outline of each lecture. He added, "Our
feeling is that it was fine to overload the content because people could
view the video at their own pace, pausing the video and/or fast
forwarding it as desired. To keep things from being boring or looking
'canned' to the students, we left enough space on the board for me to
interject supplementary remarks with the black chalk." I asked about the
filming schedule; he was not positive but said he thought it was two or
three videos a day twice a week.</p>
<p>He said, "By MIT standards I was a mediocre math student but an
excellent math instructor." Not only an excellent instructor but a most
generous one. Herb Gross and MIT have done the calculus student an
immense service.</p></div>
