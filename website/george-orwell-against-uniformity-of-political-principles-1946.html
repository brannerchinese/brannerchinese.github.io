		<div><p>George Orwell (1903–1950):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Swift was a kind of anarchist, and Part IV of <em>Gulliver's Travels</em> is
a picture of an anarchistic Society, not governed by law in the
ordinary sense, but by the dictates of 'Reason', which are voluntarily
accepted by everyone. ... This illustrates very well the totalitarian
tendency which is explicit in the anarchist or pacifist vision of
Society. In a Society in which there is no law, and in theory no
compulsion, the only arbiter of behaviour is public opinion. But
public opinion, because of the tremendous urge to conformity in
gregarious animals, is less tolerant than any system of law. When
human beings are governed by 'thou shalt not', the individual can
practise a certain amount of eccentricity: when they are supposedly
governed by 'love' or 'reason', he is under continuous pressure to
make him behave and think in exactly the same way as everyone else.
... It is often argued, at least by people who admit the importance of
subject-matter, that a book cannot be 'good' if it expresses a
palpably false view of life. We are told that in our own age, for
instance, any book that has genuine literary merit will also be more
or less 'progressive' in tendency. This ignores the fact that
throughout history a similar struggle between progress and reaction
has been raging, and that the best books of any one age have always
been written from several different viewpoints, some of them palpably
more false than others.</p>
