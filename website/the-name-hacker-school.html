		<div><p>I spent three months this year in the Winter 2013 batch of <a href="http://hackerschool.com">Hacker
School</a>. Below are some thoughts on what the organization is — since
the name is misleading, to say the least — excerpted from my feedback to
the organization. (In an <a href="http://brannerchinese.wordpress.com/2013/02/11/two-things-i-am-thinking-about-as-hacker-school-begins/" title="Two things I am thinking about as Hacker School begins">earlier post</a> I've mentioned the fact that
"hacker" has a far more noxious meaning in the press and at large that
it does among programmers, but never mind that now.)</p>
<hr />
<p>It's not actually a school at all, except in the sense that being in it
was a lot like graduate school (I wrote <a href="http://brannerchinese.wordpress.com/2013/03/30/is-hacker-school-like-graduate-school/" title="Is Hacker School like graduate school?">a blog post about that</a>). But
what it *is* is less easy to say.</p>
<p>"Retreat" is used on the website's "about" page, along with "immersive
school". These are not bad, but I don't think either one exhausts the
meaning of the experience, not with eloquence anyway. It seems to me
that the problem with "retreat" is that there isn't really removal,
either physical or mental, from the rest of the world. "School" strongly
suggests a curriculum or program, which of course there isn't. Even if
students set their own programs, that isn't a school — it's an arena for
self-study, a different thing in essential features. Oh, go ahead and
use "school" if you need to for other purposes, but in plain truth the
word doesn't fit comfortably.</p>
<p>I've used "dojo" to describe the physical place where the batch meets.
That's good because it suggests the self-cultivation that is such an
explicit part of Japanese training in all the traditional arts. But it's
bad because a dojo is always associated with a sensei, one sensei who is
part of a tradition (even if it is the venerable tradition of standing
apart from tradition), and not only do we have no sensei in that strict
sense, we also have no sect or "school" or tradition in the intellectual
aspect of the word. Similarly, a friend who lived some time among
Jesuits said of my description of Hacker School that "it sounds like
life at a monastery" — let's not say anything about celibacy, but Hacker
School fails to meet the definition because there is no abbot and no
order (in the sense of a religious ideology or theological affiliation).
And as with "retreat", the word fails because we are not cloistered
here. If Hacker School has any ideology, it is that of the rain
forest-like chaos of the hacking world at large. Dojo and monastery,
both of which involve adherence to hierarchical rules, are not the right
names for a place that encourages this state of things.</p>
<p>"Collaborative studio" might do to describe Hacker School. "Gymnasium"
also might do. Neither requires a sensei or abbot figure, and each
suggests a place where people can work, independently or together, at
training themselves or producing work that depends on discipline or
reflective exertion or craftsmanship. That seems to me the essential
point. I recommend those two expressions, then, to describe Hacker
School.</p>
<p>"Collaborative studio" and "gymnasium" are what I say now, describing
Hacker School when I talk to people who understand about
self-cultivation. When forced to talk to grown-ups, I have been
describing Hacker School as a tech recruitment company that offers
unpaid training-internships.</p></div>
