<blockquote>
<p>Ms. Reid vividly describes how people tried to get by on virtually
inedible food substitutes: cotton-seed cakes that were normally used
as fuel in ship furnaces; sheep guts, together with calf skins from a
tannery, were turned into "meat jelly"; fermented birch sawdust was
turned into "yeast extract," which, dissolved in hot water, was
considered "yeast soup." As the civilians grew more desperate, they
scraped dry glue from the underside of wallpaper, boiled leather shoes
and belts hoping in vain that they could be eaten or at least chewed.
"Zoologists survived the siege: they knew how to catch rats and
pigeons," the author notes. "Impractical mathematicians died."</p>
<p>The most desperate turned to cannibalism. Using police records that
became available in 2004, Ms. Reid provides details where Salisbury
had to rely on unofficial and often unsubstantiated anecdotes. The
stories are gruesome. It was common for bodies to be left in
apartments among the living because of the danger of taking them to
cemeteries or even down to the street. Those that were buried were dug
up and eaten. Hospital workers took home amputated limbs. Organized
groups lured passersby into apartments with offers to barter food for
valuables, then murdered the visitors and ate them. According to
police records, there were more than 2,000 arrests for cannibalism in
Leningrad, a figure that would have to be considered well below the
true number of actual episodes.</p>
