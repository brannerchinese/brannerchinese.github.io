<blockquote>
<p>"The most striking change has been an increasing number of presidents
coming from backgrounds that are not academic. They're coming from
law, from business, and they don't have an understanding of a
commitment to the academic enterprise," said Robert Kreiser, senior
program officer with the American Association of University Presidents
(AAUP). "Their emphasis has to do with corporate values. More and
more, unfortunately, they're seen not as educators, but as managers
and fundraisers."</p>

<p>Comment: This trend has been developing ever since the 1960s, but it
really began to take off in the early- to mid-1990s. Faculty I speak to
today are generally well aware of the extent and history of
bureaucratization, because there is still good institutional,
disciplinary, and professional memory among academics. Among students,
however, and more dismayingly among lower-tier academic bureaucrats
themselves, there is very little awareness of the fact that universities
today are not much like what they were thirty years ago, to say nothing
of fifty years ago. They didn't used to be nearly so corporate.</p></div>
