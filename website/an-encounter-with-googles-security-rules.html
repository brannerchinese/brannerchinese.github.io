		<div><p>I attended a Google NYC Tech Talk yesterday evening, entitled
"<a href="">Doubleclick Ad Exchange: Connecting the World of Online
Advertising</a>". It was the most interesting of the several I have been
to (the sole exception is <a href="http://www.meetup.com/google-nyc-tech-talks/events/16885501/">one highly technical presentation by Victor
Miller a year ago</a> on hashing functions). There was a reasonable
amount of detail on some of Google's strategies for ultra low-latency
auctioning of internet advertising, and I was able to enjoy the special
pleasure that you get from listening to smart people explaining
something they know a lot about. If I was not completely won over by
three references to the market's "invisible hand" in various names, that
is the result of my own failure to believe, and Google is not to blame
for it.</p>
<p>A sideshow to the talk was a closer look than usual at some of Google's
security rules. Nothing extraordinary, and I don't think I'm putting the
company at risk in what follows, but the cumulative effect left me in a
state of mellow reflection (possibly not my normal state).</p>
<p>In the large presentation theater, we were told we could take
photographs of things within the theater itself but not of anything in
the rest of the space, all of which was completely visible from the
open-walled theater. Okay, I understand the "I shall avert my eyes" rule
and am even able to observe it. But with something over two hundred
strangers in the room, I wonder to what extent the company expects such
a rule to be honored. Making a rule without enforcing it can weaken
one's authority if someone decides to test it, and that is a risk when
the rule isn't easy to enforce, surely a temptation to some of the
contrary among us.</p>
<p>More interesting was the security downstairs. There were a number of
people on line at the desk, waiting as a security officer tried to find
someone on the phone to authorize a certain person to enter the
building. We all had our IDs ready to show him. But a moment came when
the officer let through someone who said he was going to be late to the
Tech Talk, and then suddenly all of us who said we were going to the
same place were waved through — without anyone looking at IDs, printed
Meetup "tickets", official name lists, or anything else. I was glad to
get in without further delay, but I think the security officer must have
felt the kind of pressure to which a weak functionary is most
susceptible — fear that he might get in trouble for holding up something
important. I hope the company asks itself what it says to the outside
world when a security officer feels weak and is vulnerable to silly time
pressure of this kind. For security to be respected, doesn't it have to
appear confident, patient, and utterly unruffled?</p>
<p>Inside security, I faced the familiar little desk with name badges on
it, printed from Meetup's name list. Google is now using a higher
quality name badge than it used to. That gave a more professional
feeling to the visit than used to be the case, certainly. What made me
smile to myself is that, in the lobby of what must be the most
technically innovative company now active in the US, these badges were
still being sorted by hand, as they have been ever since I started
attending the Tech Talks. And this time, the people who were passing
them out actually gave me someone else's badge, without looking at any
of my credentials or even trying to pronounce the last name on the badge
to me (I spelled mine out for them clearly). I didn't realize I had
gotten the wrong badge until I got home later in the evening and took it
off. Only the first letter is the same as in mine.</p>
<p>I guess I should be glad whoever got my badge didn't get me in trouble —
he could have photographed the opulent buffet (in the off-camera section
of the meeting space), or stayed behind past the no-peeing hour in the
men's room, or sneaked out of the building through an unauthorized exit
stairway (these were accessible but we were warned away from them in
tremulous gentleness by a junior employee).</p>
<p>I suppose it's something to be grateful for when security, so
frightening in our society in the past decade, is handled softly —
rather than with the ill-concealed hostility that has become common
elsewhere.</p>
<p>On the whole, though I've been irked with some of Google's practices in
the past weeks, I came away with a better overall impression of the
company than I had when I went in, and that surprises me a little, and
pleases me, too.</p>
