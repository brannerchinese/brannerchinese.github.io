		<div><p>I have posted my recordings of what my current Classical Chinese
students have been reading, at
<a href="https://brannerchinese.com/w3302_2012spring/recordings/">https://brannerchinese.com/w3302_2012spring/recordings/</a>.</p>
<p>There is not enough of this in the teaching of Classical Chinese — well,
there is not enough Classical Chinese in Chinese programs generally,
because many people fail to understand the centrality of "Classical" and
literary Chinese in the structure and aesthetics of modern Mandarin. I
won't preach about that here. What I want to assert now is how important
the reading aloud of texts is to learning the language they contain.
Hearing another person reading them aloud is also good, and so to aid my
students (who I require to read aloud everything we study together, from
a clean copy of the text projected on a screen) I made my own
recordings.</p>
<p>I prefaced the fifty-odd recordings in this set with these comments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I recognize that these recordings are quite helpful to you, and that
is why I have prepared them.</p>
<p>But I have misgivings about them. For one thing, they force me to
commit myself to particular character-readings and syntactic
expression in stress, whereas I prefer to keep my relationship to the
text more fluid. For another, they rob you of the chance to decide for
yourself how to interpret the text, in just those ways.</p>
<p>In the end, though, I think it is better for you to have these to
review from, in case they are of use to you for that purpose. I hope
to find time to prepare more in the next days and weeks. They are not
as good as an educative native speaker might produce, but I suspect
they will still be useful. They may also be rather soft unless you
listen to them with headphones or a properly amplified system.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that these readings reflect (a) the specific versions of
the texts that I have used in the course, ignoring what may be in your
textbooks or other versions, and (b) my best choice of readings based
on the various considerations that I consider relevant. Both
undoubtedly differ considerably from what you may encounter elsewhere,
and I urge you to listen widely and read aloud adventurously. I lean
to the 1932 standard of Mandarin rather than the mid-1950s standard,
though not in every case, and for certain words I prefer a more
conservative reading (<em>jū</em> rather than <em>jù</em> for 俱, <em>dài</em> for <em>dà</em> 大
but only in the two compounds 大王 and 大夫, etc. etc. etc.).
Generally I have avoided the old <em>rùshēng</em> 入聲 readings (<em>zé</em> for
<em>zhái</em> 宅, <em>bò</em> for <em>běi</em> 北, etc. etc.), dear though they are to my
heart.</p>
<p>To choose one's own readings is an expression of temperament as well
as understanding. My own tendencies are mainly philological and will
probably not inspire you much. But if you have the time and interest,
I recommend listening to the work of Mr. Hung Tzeh-nan 洪澤南老師, the
most gifted performer of oral Classical Chinese literature I have yet
encountered. Unfortunately, most of his work is not easy to get hold
of, but his book <em>Ták-ê lâi gîm-si</em> 大家來吟詩 is on-line at <a href="http://cls.hs.yzu.edu.tw/300/all/media/poem/poem.htm">Yuan Ze
University 元智大學's site</a>. It is true that these materials are in
Taiwanese rather than Mandarin, but they illustrate the basic nature
of the oral performance of Classical Chinese literature: that it is to
the reading of a text what <em>shūfǎ</em> 書法 (brush-pen calligraphy) is to
the physical characters — an individual expression of understanding
and mood, ranging from the exquisite heights of fine art down to (one
hopes, at least) workmanlike presentation. Unfortunately, my reading
has no artistic content, but I urge you to explore Mr. Hung's work
when you have time.</p>
