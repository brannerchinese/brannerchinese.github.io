<blockquote>
<p>…</p>
<p><p>
It is possible to imagine a society with good laws that are fully
respected but in which it is impossible to live. Conversely, one can
imagine life being quite bearable even where the laws are imperfect
and imperfectly applied. The most important thing is always the
quality of that life and whether or not the laws enhance life or
repress it, not merely whether they are upheld or not. (Often strict
observance of the law could have a disastrous impact on human
dignity.) The key to a humane, dignified, rich, and happy life does
not lie either in the constitution or in the Criminal Code. These
merely establish what may or may not be done and, thus, they can make
life easier or more difficult. They limit or permit, they punish,
tolerate, or defend, but they can never give life substance or
meaning. The struggle for what is called "legality" must constantly
keep this legality in perspective against the background of life as it
really is. Without keeping one's eyes open to the real dimensions of
life's beauty and misery, and without a moral relationship to life,
this struggle will sooner or later come to grief on the rocks of some
self-justifying system of scholastics. Without really wanting to, one
would thus become more and more like the observer who comes to
conclusions about our system only on the basis of trial documents and
is satisfied if all the appropriate regulations have been observed.</p>
