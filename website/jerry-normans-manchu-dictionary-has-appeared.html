		<div><p>I've received my copy of Jerry Norman's <em>Comprehensive Manchu-English
Dictionary</em> dictionary from the publisher. I don't see it on the Harvard
site, but here is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Comprehensive-Manchu-English-Dictionary-Harvard-Yenching-Institute/dp/0674072138" title="Amazon link for Jerry Norman's Comprehensive Manchu-English Dictionary">Amazon link</a>.</p>
<p>Below is my preface to the dictionary (with one typographical error
corrected in 五體清文鑑).</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Editor's Preface</strong></p>
<p>Jerry Lee Norman (1936–2012) was born to Okies — Depression-era refugees
from the Dust Bowl of Oklahoma, who settled down as farm workers in
California. He was fascinated with language from childhood. Denied
permission to study Latin in school, he taught himself using an old
textbook, and soon knew so much that his school asked him to teach other
students. After a stint studying Chinese in the Army Language school,
and a year preparing for the priesthood in a Benedictine priory (one
recently transplanted to the United States from China), he finally
decided his calling was to study Chinese language and so matriculated as
an undergraduate at the University of California at Berkeley. At
Berkeley he studied linguistic field methods, Chinese, and Mongolian,
continuing into the doctoral program. He also attained a high level of
fluency in Russian during those years. Norman was the principal American
student of Yuen Ren Chao 趙元任 (1892–1982) in descriptive and
historical Chinese linguistics. He spent almost his whole teaching
career at the University of Washington, Seattle.</p>
<p>The two years of his Fulbright grant in Taiwan, from 1965–67, were spent
largely on Manchu, even though he completed all the work for a
ground-breaking dissertation on Mǐn dialects of Chinese at the same
time. He told me the story in an interview in 2006:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I got to Taiwan, they had in the office there a copy of the book
by Tulišen 圖理珅 (1667–1741), who was a Manchu official sent by the
Kāngxī Emperor to Russia in something like 1725. And he wrote an
account of his journey, which is really for intelligence purposes and
so forth, and very interesting — very repetitious but very
interesting.</p>
<p>I was working on that and I constantly was coming up against this
problem that there's no Manchu dictionary in English. So I would use
the Japanese <em>Manwa jiten</em> 滿和辭典 (which also has Chinese glosses in
it, so that was quite usable). And I also had Erich Hauer's
<em>Handwörterbuch der Mandschusprache</em>. But at least half the time I'd
look the Manchu up and then I had to go and look up the German words.
So at some point I just decided, well, why not — I have all this time,
you know — maybe I should compile my own dictionary.</p>
<p>So the first thing I did was cut up the Manchu-Japanese dictionary.
Since I had research funds, I had a blueprint copy made of it, printed
only on one side. I hired an assistant to cut all the entries out and
paste them on cards. At that time in Taiwan you couldn't buy cards;
you couldn't go to the stationery store and say "I want four-by-five
cards," or any size — you had to have them made. So we had a whole
bunch of cards made and pasted all the cut-outs onto the cards. And
then we had a great big file cabinet made, with drawers, and so we put
all the cards in there — it was in alphabetical order already. I would
go into the office, early in the morning, maybe beginning at 6:30 or
7:00, and I just went through the whole thing and translated it. I had
a Japanese gloss and a Chinese gloss probably from the <em>Wǔtǐ Qīng
wénjiàn</em> 五體清文鑑 or something like that. The Japanese was
relatively simple; I could deal with most of that, with a dictionary.
And I had Hauer, and Hauer had more entries, so I sometimes added
entries that were in Hauer but weren't in the Japanese material. And
in working that way I finished the thing in about seven months — went
through all the cards in seven months.</p>
<p>Then I got another assistant who typed it up as a manuscript and went
through, corrected things, and so forth, and then I made another copy
and had it printed in Taiwan — just purely privately; I paid for it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was all done on a Fulbright to study Chinese! He added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But I had so much <em>time</em>, you know. I'd never in my life had a period
when nobody told me to do anything.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What he produced in Taiwan was only the foundation of the present book.
He spent the next forty-five years refining and expanding it by reading
Manchu documents and consulting other materials, including recordings
and transcriptions of living Sibe 錫伯 that he made in Taiwan. (He
described his teacher in Taiwan, [Kongur] Kuang Lu [孔古爾] 廣祿,
1900–73, as a gifted extempore storyteller in the Sibe tradition.) An
initial edition of the dictionary was published in 1978, but the present
volume is considerably expanded from that, and also includes a guide to
pronunciation as Norman learned it.</p>
<p>In later years, he had much help on this project from the members of a
Manchu study group based in Portland, Oregon, whom he names in his own
preface. In 2005, he asked me to begin helping him put it in order for
publication, which I have done using LaTeX (including the "multicol"
package, with gratitude to Frank Mittelbach). I am glad to acknowledge
the help of my mother, Shirley Branner — even though she knows no Manchu
or Chinese, she patiently read through the entire manuscript twice for
sense and correct order of entries. Most of the editing and typesetting
work was done in 2011 and 2012, with the very last corrections made to
the text on 28 June, 2012. Five days later, Prof. Norman entered the
hospital, and a few days after that he was gone.</p>
<p>Jerry Norman was a scholar of rare erudition, though retiring by
temperament. His memory for words and expressions, even in tongues he
did not know, left people floored. And few linguists I have known
possessed his true instinct for the workings of language. Beyond those
gifts, he was also a sincere and gentle person, whose willingness to
share what he knew touched many people far beyond his rather small
circle of students.</p>
<p>Norman's Manchu name was Elbihe, 'raccoon dog'.</p>
