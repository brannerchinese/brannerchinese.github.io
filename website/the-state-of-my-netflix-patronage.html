		<div><p>I haven't had a TV for about 15 years now. I hate commercials and inane
content so much, and when I am working on something hard I am so lacking
in willpower, that I'd rather just not have the thing in my house. My
main watching habits these days are movies or nature documentaries on
DVD, or else recent TV episodes streamed. About half of my viewing is
done while I exercise, for distraction. For a good movie, I really
prefer to see it with a lively New York audience in a theater, but
tickets are quite expensive now (\$12/person).</p>
<p>Yes, I'm pissed off by Netflix's recent changes, and I'm worried that
the plan is to sell off the DVD rental, but the company is still going
to get my business. Here's the math:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>DVD rental</strong>. No viable commercial competitors remain to Netflix's
    DVD rental service. Blockbuster's has slower turnover even if you
    trek to the store for returns, as well as a smaller collection of
    disks on hand in my area. RedBox seems to be defunct. There are much
    smaller services in other cities, and they cost far more. The New
    York Public Library (sounds of cheering) has passable offerings at
    no cost, but they're smaller than Netflix's, there is often a very
    long wait, and disks are damaged even more often than Netflix's are.
    At two disks out per month from Netflix, I can receive and watch
    15-20 per month if I time things correctly. At \$12+tax/month,
    that's <strong>\$0.65-\$0.87/disk</strong>. If the Post Office stops overnight
    delivery even within New York County, the cost to me will be forced
    up, but even if the cost doubles, Netflix is likely to remain the
    cheapest service for the largest selection. There is no viable
    alternative, and no streaming service offers the range of material I
    can get on disks.</li>
<li><strong>Streaming</strong>. Currently \$8+tax/month. I generally watch only TV
    shows this way, between three and eight episodes a week, averaging
    around 20 a month, for a net cost of <strong>\$0.44/episode</strong>. Of the
    competitors, only Amazon Prime currently comes anywhere close to
    Netflix's inventory in the areas I'm interested in, and (ignoring
    the yearly fee, which also pays shipping on books) most of the shows
    I watch would cost me \$2 or \$3/episode because they're not in the
    free-viewing category.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
So Netflix wins. Yes, I am offended by the CEO's letters. But there's no
alternative at this point. I'd only add that if the math changes, my
patronage may also change.</p></div>
