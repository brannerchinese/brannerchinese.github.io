		<div><p>In an article published by the Cato Institute, Steve H. Hanke and
Richard Conn Henry have proposed using a single time zone around the
world. They write:</p>
<p>
> This would mean that bank employees in the far East of Russia would
> start work with the sun well up in the sky, while bank employees in
> the far west of Russia would be at their desks before the sun has
> risen. But, across the country, they could conduct business with one
> another, all the working day. … One time throughout the world, one
> date throughout the world. Refill dates for prescription drugs would
> be the same day of the month, every month, every year. Business
> meetings, sports schedules and school calendars would be identical
> every year. Today's cacophony of time zones, daylight savings times,
> and calendar fluctuations, year-after-year (sic) would be over. The
> economy — that's all of us — would receive a permanent "harmonization
> dividend." (["Changing Times,"
> http://www.cato.org/pub\_display.php?pub\_id=13940][], accessed

</p>

<p>And when would the working day be? Whose convenience would be served —
who would get to be awake during normal daylight in a unified global
work day?</p>
<p>Actually, China already uses a single time zone (Beijing time, <em>Běijīng
shíjiān</em> 北京時間) across almost all its own territory, all the way to
the western borders of its Central Asian possessions. Fewer degrees of
longitude are involved than in the case of Russia, but the Chinese
example shows that it is grimly over-optimistic to think we can regulate
people on a turning globe* to live according to a single working day.</p>
<p>The Chinese single time zone is primarily an expression of central
political power over the localities. But there is no question of people
in the non-Han far west actually getting up and going to sleep at the
same times as people in the Han east. People simply will not do that
without coercion. They start work when the daylight is normal for them
to start work, of course. If you want to talk to someone living many
degrees of longitude away, you still have to figure out when they're
awake or at work.</p>
<p>"Harmonization dividends", meaning not having to think about complicated
things, do not come into it.</p>
<p>For China, where "harmony" (<em>héxié</em> 和諧) is a current catchword for
obedience to authority, the only "harmonization dividend" from this
system is the lip service paid to the single time zone of the east: a
unified metric appears to be in use, but in reality people just ignore
it when it ceases to be convenient.</p>
<hr />
<p></p>
* Of course, if the turning globe had one pole permanently toward the
sun, a single time zone would be easy to enforce, and most of the
population would live in the sunlit area. Stay tuned to see if someone
proposes that next.</p>
