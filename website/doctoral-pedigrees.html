		<div><p>The <a href="http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/">Mathematics Genealogy Project at North Dakota State University</a>
documents lines of academic filiation (primarily through doctoral
degrees) in mathematics. It makes for interesting reading. Though my
degree is "Asian Linguistics", I can connect myself to the mainstream
mathematical tree through a sub-branch of four progenitor <em>Doktorväter</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Josiah Royce, 1878 (Philosophy)</li>
<li>Henry M. Sheffer, 1908 (Philosophy)</li>
<li>Yuen Ren Chao 趙元任, 1918 (Philosophy)</li>
<li>Jerry Norman, 1969 (Oriental Languages)</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
[Update 20111213: Chao and Sheffer are now in the tree; see <a href="http://brannerchinese.wordpress.com/2011/12/13/y-r-chao-and-henry-sheffer-added-to-the-mathematics-genealogy-project/" title="Y. R. Chao and Henry Sheffer added to the Mathematics Genealogy Project">this
post</a>.] Sheffer and initially Chao studied logic, a field developed at
Harvard by Royce. Sheffer is best known for having introduced the NAND
operation to Boolean logic. Chao's main scholarly contributions were in
Chinese historical phonology and modern grammar. Jerry Norman has
pioneered the rigorous study of Chinese dialect classification, which
you might say is a type of applied logic.</p>
<p>Through Royce, I can trace my "pedigree" to various luminaries of the
Humanist era: Erasmus, Vesalius, Ficino, Copernicus, Leibniz, and Marin
Mersenne, a student of prime numbers after whom is named the Mersenne
twister, a pseudo-random number generator now widely used on personal
computers. To Kant, as well, and to non-Humanists like Thomas à Kempis
and Thomas Cranmer. Most lines peter out in the early 15th century;
earlier stragglers include the mathematician and theologian Heinrich von
Langenstein, an antecedent of Copernicus who received his Theol. Dr. in
1375, while the neo-Platonist Georgios Plethon Gemistos seems to have
received the first of his degrees in 1380.</p>
<p>There is romance in seeing one's connection to people like Leibniz and
Erasmus, but it means little beyond that. Does anyone with a PhD today,
in any field, not belong to those lines of filiation? As of today,
Erasmus is shown to have 95301 descendants listed in mathematics alone.
I have learned an enormous amount from Jerry Norman, and it is justice
to call him my <em>Doktorvater</em>. I find myself in strong agreement with
Chao's model of formal Chinese historical phonology, too, and I have a
special love for logic. But the model of linguistic fieldwork I use owes
considerably more to Robert Austerlitz and Li Fang Kuei 李方桂 than to
Chao, whose approach I consider altogether too literary. I also identify
myself intellectually with my maternal grandfather, who left school when
he was 12 but was a voracious reader and lifelong pursuer of ideas. At
best, all that a paper pedigree can do is remind me to try to be true to
the effort that generations of scholars, known and unknown, have made in
order to seek knowledge and see clearly — to those ideas and those
people all human beings are equally heirs.</p>
