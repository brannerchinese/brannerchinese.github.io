		<div><p>My stint in the sixth "batch" of <a href="http://hackerschool.com">Hacker School</a> begins on 11
February, four days hence. I anticipate three months of intense growth
as a programmer, and "reticulation" with a great many interesting souls.</p>
<p>Hacker School is not a school but a dojo for programmers at all levels.
It also functions as a recruiter for the lively tech industry in New
York. I know much less about it today than I expect to next week or in
the summer, but these two facts are clear. And both make it seem an
experience not to be missed. I have been studying Computer Science
part-time at City College for three years and have just finished the six
courses making up the undergraduate minor — Hacker School appears to be
an ideal next step for me.</p>
<hr />
<p>I submitted an application as soon as the current competition opened and
was interviewed twice for it, each time by just one person: first, I had
what seemed to me an interview exploring my personality and public
voice, and not long after that, one dealing more directly with coding.
Neither was in any way stressful. Both interviewers had conversation
styles that invited me to listen and to speak, and both seemed attentive
to what I had to say. The interviews took place over Skype.</p>
<p>For the coding interview I had sent HaSch a little progress-bar class I
had written quickly in Python at the end of June and early July, just
after the <a href="http://brannerchinese.wordpress.com/2012/02/22/manchu-dictionary-done/" title="Manchu dictionary done">Manchu dictionary was done</a> and while <a href="http://brannerchinese.wordpress.com/2012/07/16/jerry-norman-1936-2012/" title="Jerry Norman (1936–2012)">my teacher was in
his brief last illness</a>. It had been my first foray into what passes
for multiprocessing in Python. I had left the project, I recalled, in a
working but highly inefficient state and I thought it would be a good
subject for a refactoring session, which is what the second interview
was supposed to dance around.</p>
<p>About half an hour before the interview I decided to make sure the code
actually worked. It did not. So rather than going calmly into a
refactoring session, I was in high debug-mania when the interview
started. By then I had already identified and fixed two principal bugs,
and my mania had helped me to review the details of the code far better
than I had managed just by reading over it a few times on the subway.
The conversation was fun, and I knew I would be lucky — really graced —
to be accepted, if only for the pleasure of working with my interviewer
again. The original plan had been to work on the code using
<a href="http://PiratePad.net">PiratePad</a> (a site that allows synchronized text-editing by multiple
users), but the interviewer and I conducted the whole discussion by
voice, each of us looking at the same code on our separate machines. It
couldn't have gone more smoothly, and she left me with a good question
to ponder about my project.</p>
<p>I was notified of my admission before the end of the day of the second
interview, and rather than being excited I felt intense gratitude for
the invitation to be part of this unusual project.</p>
<p>The practice seems to be to refer to batches using array-index notation:
batch 6 is called "batch[5]".</p>
<hr />
<p>Applications closed on 22 January, a week later than advertised. A
mailing list was set up the same day, and threads quickly opened on
housing, insurance, and self-introductions. I suspect interviews
continued for some days after that, but recently we were told there were
45 of us in the current batch. We've heard that an introductory document
is in the works, but apart from a somewhat stern reminder not to be
obnoxious ("lightweight social rules" — "no subtle sexism" is perhaps
the least lightweight of them, considering HaSch's mission to guide more
women into the aggressive world of coding), nothing of a general nature
has materialized — do I sound as though I'm complaining? there's no
rush, of course. The organization has, for the first time, found
semi-permanent space for itself near the Canal Street station of the
West Side IRT, which will speed my commute. I can see that a lot of work
is going on behind the scenes.</p>
<p>In the past eight days I've met five other members of this batch
one-on-one, each for long enough to talk about serious things and get a
good taste of their temperaments. All seem to me to invite more of my
time in conversation. One is only minimally experienced at coding.
Another has a coding background not far from mine — experienced, but not
very, and in need of more intensive exposure. And the remaining three
have been working for some years as developers. I suppose these are the
three main types of background I will encounter.</p>
<hr />
<p>I have thought hard about what sorts of projects to work on over these
three months. Although many of the advanced batchlings seem to be
interested in working through an on-line algorithms course or in Clojure
and other functional languages, I feel the need to get more practice at
tools I have already been exposed to but have not used extensively. As a
teacher I always place proficiency as my highest goal, and if I had one
disappointment in my City College education it was that proficiency — in
math and in coding — was not first among the program's goals for me. I
originally mentioned "more practice with familiar tools" in my initial
interview, when asked what I might spend my time on, but now after
considering the alternatives named by other people I feel much surer
that doing this is the best plan for me.</p>
<p>I will aim for greater mastery of the whole web-dev/SQL/scraping stack
surrounding Python. As of today, I envision starting by building a
scraper feeding a simple SQL database, then rebuilding my
http://yintong.info site using Python and PostgreSQL (as I have long
wanted to do), and finally building a more elaborate NLP project
featuring web-scraped Chinese sentences and a parser. If I can get these
three projects running smoothly with time to spare, it would be
interesting to build parallel versions in some second language, such as
Ruby, which is so popular in New York right now.</p>
<p>But I hope I am ready for unexpected changes in direction, too.</p>
<hr />
<p>I have prepared a VirtualBox installation of Ubuntu 12.04 server as my
working environment, and am hurrying to get an old MoinMoin wiki
restored for use as an on-line notebook.</p>
<p>It's my intention to record my impressions of this experience on this
blog, too.</p></div>
