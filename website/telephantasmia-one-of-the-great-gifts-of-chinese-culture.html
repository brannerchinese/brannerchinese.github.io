		<div><p>A colleague mentioned the vexed question of whether the Chinese language
makes hypothesis and counterfactual thinking more difficult, since it is
rarely marked grammatically the way it is in languages possessing a
subjective mood.</p>
<p>I'm unable to generalize to my own satisfaction about the question "are
Chinese speakers less able to hypothesize than speakers of other
languages?" Before hazarding opinions on the subject, I would review
cognitive measurements of people engaged in the act of
counterfactualizing, something I know has been studied. But where
language alone is concerned, my professional view as a linguistic
sinologist is that the distinctive topic-comment syntax of Chinese
merely makes it harder to <em>distinguish</em> counterfactuals decisively from
non-counterfactuals — a counterfactual actually becomes easier to
produce but harder to recognize than if morphology were involved.</p>
<p>Whether all that translates to sociological conclusions is not for me to
say. I will venture, though, that the tendency of non-Chinese people to
imagine or believe unbelievable things about China and its culture must
be unequaled in the world. We may feel smug about the foolishness of
Western men caught in Chinese honey traps when we recall the cases of
Bernard Boursicot and Shí Pèipú 時佩璞 (basis of the "M. Butterfly"
story) or Katrina Leung 陳文英 and her friends in the U.S. government
(subjects of a failed spy prosecution in the Bush-Cheney era). But what
is there to laugh at, when much of the non-Chinese world also gazes on
China with eyes heavily clouded by fantasy — sometimes admiring,
sometimes hostile, but fantasy nonetheless? It seems to me that
fantasies about Chinese language and culture are common even within
Chinese society, itself.</p>
<p>Perhaps all this is the result of <strong><em>telephantasmia</em></strong>
"counterfactualism at a distance" as a feature of Chinese culture - the
generation of useful fictions in observers's minds. Could <em>that</em> somehow
be related to the lack of counterfactual marking in Chinese grammar?</p></div>
