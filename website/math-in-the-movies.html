		<div><p>Today a cryptographer said in my presence, "In the movies, the only
option for a math guy is to go crazy." Certainly, it seems that math is
more often used as a symbol of deep or contorted thinking than as an
achievable skill or pastime for a normal person.</p>
<p>But maybe the situation is not quite so bad. Since 1996, Arnold Reinhold
has been collecting references to math in a website currently at
<a href="http://world.std.com/~reinhold/mathmovies.html">http://world.std.com/~reinhold/mathmovies.html</a> . Mathematics seems to
make a few worthy appearances.</p>
<p>But hardly as many as there might be. What does this say about
Anglophone society? I have the impression mathematics is taken more
seriously as a pursuit for normal people in South and East Asia, Russia,
and Israel — I wonder if the situation better in movies made in those
places. Or maybe the movie-making world and the world of mathematical
competence are just about mutually exclusive, and so few pathways exist
for improving the portrayal of math in the movies.</p>
<p>Actually, I am not bothered so much by depictions of crazy
mathematicians. There have been, after all, some great mathematicians
with spectactularly quirky personalities, if not outright mental illness
— Cantor, Gödel, Boltzmann, and Newton come to mind among the first-rung
names, and there are many others elsewhere in the vast nimbus of minds.
Being strange or mentally ill does not of itself invalidate a person's
thoughts, in any case. (Does that really need to be said?) What bothers
me most is the standard cinematic trope of of the math genius who has
instant insights and doesn't need to work to prove or develop them. You
might call it the Rāmānujan syndrome. Wesley Crusher and Will Hunting
are prime examples. It's hard to think of a stereotype more damaging to
the development of healthy intellectual skills in normal people.</p>
<p>Something could be done to correct this stereotyping, which I'm sure
takes place because of ignorance rather than ill will on the part of
scriptwriters and directors. How about a movie or two in which
problem-solving is shown as it really is: something carried out by
normal people through patient hard work and practice, through a skill
that can be cultivated by the sane and the normal. After all, solving
problems of one sort or another is something everyone does, and it is
rarely a matter of sudden inspiration — instant, complete, and requiring
no further labor. Then again, maybe someone thinks that isn't dramatic
enough for a movie.</p></div>
