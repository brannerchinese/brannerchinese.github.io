> In an era when metaphysical and existential certainties are in a state
> of crisis, when people are being uprooted and alienated and are losing
> their sense of what this world means, … ideology inevitably has a
> certain hypnotic charm. To wandering humankind it offers an
> immediately available home: all one has to do is accept it, and
> suddenly everything becomes clear once more, life takes on new
> meaning, and all mysteries, unanswered questions, anxiety, and
> loneliness vanish. Of course, one pays dearly for this low-rent home:
> the price is abdication of one’ s own reason, conscience, and
> responsibility, for an essential aspect of … ideology is the
> consignment of reason and conscience to a higher authority. (II)

<blockquote>
<p>…</p>
<p>Ideology is a specious way of relating to the world. It offers human
beings the illusion of an identity, of dignity, and of morality while
making it easier for them to part with them. As the repository of
something suprapersonal and objective, it enables people to deceive
their conscience and conceal their true position and their inglorious
<em>modus vivendi</em>, both from the world and from themselves. It is a very
pragmatic but, at the same time, an apparently dignified way of
legitimizing what is above, below, and on either side. It is directed
toward people and toward God. It is a veil behind which human beings
can hide their own fallen existence, their trivialization, and their
adaptation to the status quo. (III)</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Ideology, in creating a bridge of excuses between the system and the
individual, spans the abyss between the aims of the system and the
aims of life. It pretends that the requirements of the system derive
from the requirements of life. It is a world of appearances trying to
pass for reality. (IV)</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>[Ideology] is one of the pillars of [the "post-totalitarian"] system's
external stability. This pillar, however, is built on a very unstable
foundation. It is built on lies. It works only as long as people are
willing to live within the lie. (V)</p>
<p>…</p>
<p><p>
Individuals can be alienated from themselves only because there is
something in them to alienate. The terrain of this violation is their
authentic existence. Living the truth is thus woven directly into the
texture of living a lie. It is the repressed alternative, the
authentic aim to which living a lie is an inauthentic response. Only
against this background does living a lie make any sense: it exists
because of that background. In its excusatory, chimerical rootedness
in the human order, it is a response to nothing other than the human
predisposition to truth. Under the orderly surface of the life of
lies, therefore, there slumbers the hidden sphere of life in its real
aims, of its hidden openness to truth. (VIII)</p>
