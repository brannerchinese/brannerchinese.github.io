		<div><p>While in Montréal last week, I heard a lot of unsympathetic comments
about the protesting students, who have been upset about what my
interlocutors describe as a very small tuition increase — much smaller
than the 25% per year that CUNY is going to be undergoing starting in a
few months.</p>
<p>There were smoke bombs thrown in the subway one morning we were there —
the entire system was shut down during rush hour — and earlier there had
been bags of bricks thrown on the tracks, with the same result. Riot
police used tear gas and percussion grenades against protesters some
weeks before we got there. Faculty and students tell me they have been
heckled by protesters, some wearing masks, while trying to enter
buildings. (The Montréal city government has proposed banning the
covering of one's face during a protest, and the Canadian government is
considering a similar law.) So much class time was lost at some
institutions that exams have been postponed and at least one campus
(Université de Montréal) has canceled graduation ceremonies.</p>
<p>What is most interesting about this is the clear divide between
linguistic-cultural affiliations of the students involved — it is "the
French" who are said to believe they are entitled to free education,
while some (only some) of the others whose opinions I heard in person or
read in the papers want to see the army brought in to deal with the
situation.</p>
<p>Feelings about free tuition were once high at CUNY, too. Here is a 2010
description from the New York Times:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CUNY colleges once were known as theaters of unrest. In 1970, students
shut off elevator service at Hunter College and liberated the
cafeteria by serving free food. Helmeted police officers were called,
and classes were suspended. In 1976, as CUNY finally faced an end to
free tuition, students marched in the streets of Harlem and boycotted
classes for three days, while 13 members of the English faculty
started a hunger strike.</p>
<p>In 1989, the possibility of tuition increases led students at City
College to pour glue and stick toothpicks into the locks of 400
classrooms. Students seized administration buildings and blocked
traffic across the city. In 1991, another series of protests prompted
classes to be canceled and commencement to be delayed. (<em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/20/nyregion/20cuny.html?pagewanted=all">The New York
Times</a></em>, December 20, 2010, p. A23)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are some other documents here:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://digital-archives.ccny.cuny.edu/thecampus/1967/SEPTEMBER_121_4/00000043.PDF">26 September, 1967, issue of <em>The Campus</em>, the CCNY paper</a>,
    reporting and commenting on the decision to end free tuition. See
    "Compromise Termed 'Sellout' by Head of Alumni Group" (pp. 1-2) and
    "A CU Grows in Brooklyn" (p. 2). More issues of <em>The Campus</em> may be
    found at the same site.</li>
<li><a href="http://www1.cuny.edu/mu/forum/2011/10/12/when-tuition-at-cuny-was-free-sort-of/">"When Tuition at CUNY was Free, Sort of,"</a> a 2011 account of the
    older tuition system and its replacement by financial aid. This
    account appeared as CUNY was preparing to announce tuition
    increases.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>My view is that when something good — education, for example — has a
cost to me, I tend to take it more seriously. That goes for both tuition
and homework. I am not arguing in favor of exorbitant tuition or
unreasonable workloads, though.</p>
<p>I have also found that people who audit my classes never do all the work
assigned, even when they're strongly motivated, and almost always stop
attending before the end of the term. It seems to me that the absence of
grade-pressure prevents most people from exerting themselves as much as
they might.</p></div>
