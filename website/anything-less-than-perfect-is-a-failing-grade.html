		<div><p>Recently I bought a used book from a bookstore on line — I found it
through BookFinder.com. My book arrived with reasonable dispatch and in
the same condition it was advertised as. Since everything was
satisfactory, I thought no more about it.</p>
<p>But today I've received a letter from the store's management asking me
to leave feedback about them on the Amazon website.</p>
<p>I was surprised, since Amazon had no involvement in my order with them.</p>
<p>But I was still more surprised at this request:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please note that we consider anything less than five star feedback to
be a failing grade, so please get in touch with us if there are any
problems to be resolved that we don't know about.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Evidently in the service economy, customers have to be coached as to how
to evaluate a business, so that the business's marketing needs are met
properly.</p>
<p>I am used to students writing to say they want an A or A+ and will work
as hard as necessary to get one. And I am well aware of my own
grievously arrogant perfectionism in my studies — which has the benefit
of motivating me but also the pitfall of making me want to quit if I
can't reach my ideals.</p>
<p>Until this morning, I had thought of these cases as character flaws —
entitlement or vanity. It's a new thought to me that my students and I
may also be practicing a kind of marketing spin.</p></div>
