<blockquote>
<p>…</p>
<p>A "dissident," we are told in our press, means something like
"renegade" or "backslider." But dissidents do not consider themselves
renegades for the simple reason that they are not primarily denying or
rejecting anything. On the contrary, they have tried to affirm their
own human identity, and if they reject anything at all, then it is
merely what was false and alienating in their lives, that aspect of
living within a lie.</p>
<p>But that is not the most important thing. The term "dissident"
frequently implies a special profession, as if, along with the more
normal vocations, there were another special one grumbling about the
state of things. In fact, a "dissident" is simply a physicist, a
sociologist, a worker, a poet, individuals who are doing what they
feel they must and, consequently, who find themselves in open conflict
with the regime. This conflict has not come about through any
conscious intention on their part, but simply through the inner logic
of their thinking, behavior, or work (often confronted with external
circumstances more or less beyond their control). They have not, in
other words, consciously decided to be professional malcontents,
rather as one decides to be a tailor or a blacksmith. (XIII)</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>If "dissidents" have any kind of authority at all, and if they have
not been exterminated long ago like exotic insects that have appeared
where they have no business being, then this is not because the
government holds this exclusive group and their exclusive ideas in
such awe, but because it is perfectly aware of the potential political
power of living within the truth rooted in the hidden sphere, and well
aware too of the kind of world "dissent" grows out of and the world it
addresses: the everyday human world, the world of daily tension
between the aims of life and the aims of the system. (XIII)</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>It is truly a cruel paradox that the more some citizens stand up in
defense of other citizens, the more they are labeled with a word that
in effect separates them from those "other citizens." (XIII)</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>It is hard to say how much worse things would be if there were not
many hard-working people who simply refuse to give up and try
constantly to do the best they can, paying an unavoidable minimum to
living within a lie so that they might give their utmost to the
authentic needs of society. These people assume, correctly, that every
piece of good work is an indirect criticism of bad politics, and that
there are situations where it is worthwhile going this route, even
though it means surrendering one's natural right to make direct
criticisms. (XIV)</p>
<p>…</p>
<p><p>
You do not become a "dissident" just because you decide one day to
take up this most unusual career. You are thrown into it by your
personal sense of responsibility, combined with a complex set of
external circumstances. You are cast out of the existing structures
and placed in a position of conflict with them. It begins as an
attempt to do your work well, and ends with being branded an enemy of
society. (XIV)</p>
