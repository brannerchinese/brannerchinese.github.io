		<div><p>I am running out of the linden flower tea that I bought on a trip to
Barcelona (where it is called <em>til·la</em>) and the licorice tea I bought on
a trip to Lund (where it is called <em>lakritste</em>), and I must find steady
replacements soon.</p>
<p>There was a time when linden flowers and fennel were among the varieties
of herb tea I could get around my New York neighborhood, in ordinary
packaging in a number of supermarkets. Now everything seems to be
proprietary-sounding health-mixtures: "Mother-To-Be", "Joint Comfort",
"Om", "Skin DeTox", and so on. Peppermint and chamomile are almost the
only two you can easily buy that don't have cloyingly fruity ingredients
or real tea in them. Hibiscus is available here and there. I have a
feeling there is also now a lot more Chinese and Japanese tea in
supermarkets than there used to be — though of far lower quality than
what I am used to, through my special sources. Frankly, I was happier
with a bigger choice of raw ingredients.</p>
<p>Finally, though, I found linden flowers ("lime blossom", "tilleul",
etc.), lemon verbena, lavender, and fennel — all for sale at Fairway in
their own cheap plastic packaging. An alternative is probably Kalustyan
on Lexington in the 20s, where a vast choice of herbs, but overpriced,
is to be found. However, Fairway on 131st St. is nearer and cheaper. I
will continue to try to buy plain herbs and steep them singly or in my
own unnamed mixtures as long as I can. There is, of course, always
Chinatown for a wide selection of certain things — licorice root, for
instance.</p></div>
