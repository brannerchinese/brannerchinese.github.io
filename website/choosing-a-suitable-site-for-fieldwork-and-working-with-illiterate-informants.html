		<div><p>I spent a formative part of my first career doing dialect fieldwork in
an effort to document conservative forms of Chinese that would soon
disappear. In the Spring of 2010, I was asked how to pick a location
that would be useful and find a really good illiterate informant. (For
many Western fieldworkers studying unwritten languages, illiterate
speakers are preferred.) Below was my response.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As for "useful", it depends on what you want to use it for. I went to
the places I did in order to answer a specific set of questions about
issues in classification. But my view is that any location is fine,
provided you have superb informants there and know how to make full
use of them. The informant is always the limiting factor. If I felt
myself free to continue doing fieldwork, I would work with any
appropriate person I could find, regardless of what they spoke. If you
have a good informant, you can get good data, and with good data you
can always find interesting things. So never mind the place — any will
do.</p>
<p>I have not had the best luck with illiterate people in China.
Basically, I think that literacy is such a central part of Chinese
culture that anyone who has linguistic skills will learn how to read.
It's quite a different matter with some of the minority languages.</p>
<p>There are definite character traits associated with being a good
informant, and having a "verbal personality" is one of them. The
ability to explain the same word consistently on different days, to
enunciate tones clearly and be able to say whether two syllables have
the same tones or not, to explain the functioning of grammar words and
idioms — things like these are what we are interested in, and knowing
Mandarin and how to read does not lessen the informant's ability to do
them. But in my experience, someone Chinese who has these skills and
has nonetheless not learned how to read — well, such people are few.</p>
<p>The personality and ability of the informant are the key to
everything. I wouldn't insist on illiteracy.</p>
