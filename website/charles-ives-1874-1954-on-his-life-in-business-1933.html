		<div><p>The composer Charles Ives (1874–1954) worked professionally not as a
musician but as a life insurance executive. He was once quoted in an
interview:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My business experience revealed life to me in many aspects that I
might otherwise have missed. In it one sees tragedy, nobility,
meanness, high aims, low aims, brave hopes, faint hopes, great ideals,
no ideals, and one is able to watch these work inevitable destiny. And
it has seemed to me that the finer sides of these traits were not only
in the majority but in the ascendancy. I have seen men fight honorably
and to a finish, solely for a matter of conviction or of principle —
and where expediency, probable loss of business, prestige or position
had no part and threats no effect. It is my impression that there is
more open-mindedness and willingness to examine carefully the premises
underlying a new or unfamiliar thing, before condemning it, in the
world of business than in the world of music. It is not even uncommon
in business intercourse to sense a reflection of a philosophy — a
depth of something fine — akin to a strong beauty in art. To assume
that business is a material process, and only that, is to undervalue
the average mind and heart. To an insurance man there <em>is</em> an 'average
man' and he is humanity. I have experienced a great fullness of life
in business. The fabric of existence weaves itself whole. You can not
set an art off in the corner and hope for it to have vitality, reality
and substance. There can be nothing <em>'exclusive'</em> about a substantial
art. It comes directly out of the heart of experience of life and
thinking about life and living life. My work in music helped my
business and my work in business helped my music.</p>
</blockquote>

music" (1933). Reprinted in James Peter Burkholder, <em>Charles Ives and
his World</em>, (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1996), pp 374-5.</p></div>
