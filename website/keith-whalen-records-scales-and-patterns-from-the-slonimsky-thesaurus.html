		<div><p>The Twentieth Century saw many astonishing developments in music. To me,
one of the most brilliant is the contact that took place between
European serialism and African-American jazz. The linchpin of the
contact was the book by Nicolas Slonimsky (1894–1995), <em>A Thesaurus of
Scales and Melodic Patterns</em> (1947), which introduced large numbers of
scales and other patterns built of intervals in non-traditional
combinations. Slonimsky described the beginnings of his project in his
memoir, <em>Perfect Pitch</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Parallel to my exploration of musical exotica, an idea began to form
in my restless mind whether an entirely new taxonomy of scales and
melodic patterns could not be formed outside major and minor
modalities. … I viewed the entire evolution of musical composition
before the present as a constricting course limited to the arbitrary
compass of seven diatonic degrees, with occasional chromatics growing
inside and outside a given mode. The antiphonal strength of modulatory
processes and fugal imitation had its source in the unequal division
of the octave into two parts, from the tonic to the dominant and from
the dominant to the tonic, leading to non-symmetric procedures.
<em>Oxford University Press, 1988, Chapter 16, "Interpolation:
Grossmutterakkord", p. 172</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://whalenatorsblog.blogspot.com/">Keith Whalen, a Montréal guitarist</a>, has recorded a number of the
scales that are suited to the guitar, as part of his wider study of
scales and tonalities. It is useful to have this material in recorded
form, and I am very grateful to Whalen. Here are a couple of examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Heptatonic and Bitonal Arpeggios:
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMHfNAFv9vk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMHfNAFv9vk</a></li>
<li>Pentatonics: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHbFu0q_2Vw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHbFu0q_2Vw</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There are other recordings of related material around, too, but Whalen's
is fairly extensive.</p>
<p>The Thesaurus is apparently the property of the Macmillan Publishing
Company and is currently available in a paperback edition from Amsco
Publications, a New York company that issues school materials and some
sheet music.</p></div>
