		<div><p>For writers and translators struggling to find the right mode of
expression, the example of the singer David Daniels holds penetrating
promise:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Upset that he couldn't control the higher tenor-range tones — "I
couldn't sing in the top part of my voice," he says, "everything would
flip and crack, flip up into the falsetto" — he sought the help of a
therapist who'd worked with singers with stage anxieties.</p>
<p>"I told her about my other voice," said the affable Daniels, 31,
chatting at the Opera House recently, "how it felt so natural, how I
could do anything I wanted to do with it: sing high and low, soft and
loud, and never worry about making an ugly, horrible sound. She didn't
understand what I meant by 'other voice,' as if it were separate from
me, (when) it's not, it's part of me, who I am."</p>
<p>Daniels decided to "make the switch" to countertenor after consulting
with his teacher, George Shirley, who wasn't entirely surprised:
Earlier, Daniels had brought him a tape of himself singing a Verdi
aria but told him it was a female friend. Shirley loved the sound and
after a few minutes realized who it was.</p>
<p>"Everything about me changed," says Daniels, who grew up in a musical
family in South Carolina and sang professionally as a boy soprano. "I
had a complete air of confidence and security." Switching to
countertenor, he says, freed him to do "everything I felt
dramatically, musically, technically and emotionally that I couldn't
get out as a tenor. I can let myself concentrate on things that are
really important — portraying a character and communicating emotion to
an audience."</p>
