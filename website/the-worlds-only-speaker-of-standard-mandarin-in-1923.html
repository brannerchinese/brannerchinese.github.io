		<div><p>The story of Y. R. Chao being, at one time, the only person in the world
who could speak the current standard version of Mandarin:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chao: … I mentioned the addition of the entering tone (in addition to
the first, second, third and fourth tones) with glottal stop endings.
Those were the main features of this artificial [<em>guóyīn</em> 國音], and I
made a special set of records for it and a textbook to go with it.</p>
<p>Levenson: Was that the first set in 1923?</p>
<p>Chao: Yes, they were made in--I went to America in '21 and I made the
record in New York with Columbia Phonograph Company.</p>
<p>Levenson: I've heard it said that you were the only person who could
speak that language in the whole world. [Laughter] What were, to your
mind, the primary objections to the artificial language?</p>
<p>Chao: For one thing, it was hard to find teachers who could speak it
naturally. For example, when I made the records, I was the only person
who could talk in that pronunciation, whereas, after the change, you
had about one million speakers who would be possible teachers.</p>
