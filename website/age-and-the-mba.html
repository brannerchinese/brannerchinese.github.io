		<div><p>A correspondent challenged me to produce any reputable-looking on-line
accounts alleging that older MBAs have difficulty getting hired in the
corporate world. I pointed out that "older MBA" tends to mean "over 30"
in these discussions, rather than "over 45", but in five minutes I found
these three substantial references:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Sarah Butcher, writing on 23 February 2010.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Age discrimination laws mean banks will never admit to turning
their noses up at fresh MBAs aged 33+, but this is the reality.
Hiring a recent MBA aged 40+ is totally unheard of. "As a general
rule, banks hire MBAs into their associate programmes when they
are in their high 20s and low 30s," says Julian Birkinshaw, deputy
dean at the London Business School.</p>
<p></p>
"There isn't an age at which it's too old to do an MBA, but there
is a point at which big name recruiters will stop being very
interested in you," Birkinshaw adds. "They will never say this,
but the reality is that organizations like banks are looking for
people who will give them the best years of their lives and who
have the potential to become managing directors before the age of
40."</p>

<p>Allan Hoffman, apparently writing in 2004 (undated):  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mike Sweeny, managing director/project staffing for T. Williams
Consulting, a strategic staffing consulting firm based in
Collegeville, Pennsylvania, says he wouldn't hesitate in hiring
someone over 50. But some companies, he notes, may see things
differently, particularly when it comes to dot coms with a young
staff. "If the place is filled with mohawks and tattoos, and the
CEO is 34 years old," he says, "chances are they're not going to
hire someone 55 or older."

<p>Arthur Delaney, writing on 15 May, 2012:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The equation changes when you are over 50. Unfortunately, it is
very difficult to get a corporate job at that age. Companies like
hiring younger people, who they feel can often do the same work at
a lower price. Yes, I know, the older person has more wisdom and
experience, but ask yourself, when was the last time you hired
someone over 50?</p>
<p></p>
With rare (although not impossible) opportunities in the corporate
world, the experienced person is forced to look elsewhere, and
will quickly discover that he can be much happier, fulfilled, and
even bankable by working for himself. This is the time to consult,
advise, mentor, and teach. This is also the time to try to start
that new company idea that you have always had in the back of your
mind.</p>

<p>There is actually a great deal of this kind on line. Rather than
wallowing in the maudlin, consider this advice (excerpted) about how to
approach the issue productively from Deborah Knox of Insight Admissions:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>First and foremost, make sure you're very competitive. …</li>
<li>If you're looking to switch careers, do your research and find out
    if making the move to your new career of choice is likely. …</li>
<li>Prepare the best application possible, …</li>
<li>Consider applying to at least a few schools that have a higher
    average age, assuming you'd be happy to attend their program. …</li>
<li>Don't completely reject the part-time and EMBA options, especially
    if you need the skills more than the brand and the network. …</li>
</ul>
