		<div><p>I continue to reflect on different kinds of thinking I rely on in my
current activities.</p>
<p>My study of and research on Chinese involves a kind of technical
thinking about abstract linguistic categories, but those categories and
the evidence for them require doing long stretches of basically
mechanical, clerical work — collation of field notes or minute
philological details — the aptitude for which the people at the Johnson
O'Connor foundation call "graphoria". In this work one does relatively
little interesting original thinking, except to the extent that one is
aware of the higher-level problems to which the mechanical work and the
minute details will contribute. And there is also something meditative
and satisfying about paying close attention to minute details for a long
stretch of time, so the work by no means simply mindless rote action.
Working with Chinese words, spoken and written, in particular, seems to
stir my musical and graphic-analytical proclivities, and I have the
sensation that Chinese grammar moves a kind of structural thinking, as
well. So the mechanical work is not without its interest and
satisfactions, though those do not compare to the kind of thinking one
can eventually do when one has the necessary data assembled for actually
attacking a problem in a unified way. I often think that one of the
things that makes formal linguistics so uninteresting is that its
practitioners seem to spend a lot of time avoiding actually handling
data at length.</p>
<p>In programming and mathematics, however, neither the graphoria nor any
aspect of language or music aptitudes seem to be directly helpful. In
fact, I often find that my motivation to turn my mind to non-linguistic
quantitative thinking is hindered by whatever time I have recently spent
on mechanical or linguistic work, because those are inevitably easier to
pick up quickly than math or a complex programming task. I experience a
wrenching "code-switching" moment when I have to do this. I have still
to find a good way to get my mind into the mood for math quickly if I
have been doing those "lower"-level tasks. The only effective way I have
found so far is to put clerical tasks completely away from myself for
weeks at a time, but in real life it is not possible to do that, and
certainly not for the coming half year, until my last two or three book
projects are done.</p>
<p>I get a little help from using a timer to force myself to to spend some
period of time working concentratedly on one type of task before
switching to another. But the code-switching remains jarring even with
the pressure of the timer to aid the switch. I wonder daily if
overcoming code-switching is after all simply a matter of patience and
concentration.</p></div>
