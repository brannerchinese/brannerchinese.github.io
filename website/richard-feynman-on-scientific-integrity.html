		<div><p>Richard Feynman (1918–1988):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… There is <em>one</em> feature I notice that is generally missing in Cargo
Cult Science. That is the idea that we all hope you have learned in
studying science in school — we never explicitly say what this <em>is</em>,
but just hope that you catch on by all the examples of scientific
investigation. It is interesting, therefore, to bring it out now and
speak of it explicitly. It's a kind of scientific integrity, a
principle of scientific thought that corresponds to a kind of utter
honesty‚ a kind of leaning over backwards. For example, if you're
doing an experiment, you should report everything that you think might
make it invalid — not only what you think is right about it: other
causes that could possibly explain your results; and things you
thought of that you've eliminated by some other experiment, and how
they worked — to make sure the other fellow can tell they have been
eliminated.</p>
<p>Details that could throw doubt on your interpretation must be given,
if you know them. You must do the best you can if you know anything at
all wrong, or possibly wrong — to explain it. If you make a theory,
for example, and advertise it, or put it out, then you must also put
down all the facts that disagree with it. …</p>
<p>In summary, the idea is to try to give <em>all</em> the information to help
others to judge the value of your contribution; not just the
information that leads to judgment in one particular direction or
another.</p>
<p>The easiest way to explain this idea is to contrast it, for example,
with advertising. …</p>
<p>We've learned from experience that the truth will out. Other
experimenters will repeat your experiment and find out whether you
were wrong or right. Nature's phenomena will agree or they'll disagree
with your theory. And, although you may gain some temporary fame and
excitement, you will not gain a good reputation as a scientist if you
haven't tried to be very careful in this kind of work. And it's this
type of integrity, this kind of care not to fool yourself, that is
missing to a large extent in much of the research in Cargo Cult
Science. … (pp. 209–10)</p>
<hr />
<p>The first principle is that you must not fool yourself — and you are
the easiest person to fool. So you have to be very careful about that.
After you've not fooled yourself, it's easy not to fool other
scientists. You just have to be honest in a conventional way after
that. …</p>
<p>I'm talking about a specific, extra type of integrity that is not
lying, but bending over backwards to show how you're maybe wrong, that
you ought to do when acting as a scientist.</p>
<p>… One example of the principle is this: If you've made up your mind to
test a theory, or you want to explain some idea, you should always
decide to publish it whichever way it comes out. If we only publish
results of a certain kind, we can make the argument look good. We must
publish <em>both</em> kinds of results. … (pp. 212–13)</p>
<hr />
<p>I have no more time, so I have just one wish for you — the good luck
to be somewhere where you are free to maintain the kind of integrity I
have described, and where you do not feel forced by a need to maintain
your position in the organization, or financial support, or so on, to
lose your integrity. May you have that freedom. (p. 216)</p>
