<p>"The Anatolian Greeks are completely terrorised people. My father's
family comes from the interior of Asia Minor, from a city called
Kayseri, and they never forgot they were part of a minority. They were
surrounded with periodic slaughters — or riots: the Turks would suddenly
have a crisis and massacre a lot of Armenians, or they'd run wild and
kill a lot of Greeks. The Greeks stayed in their houses. The fronts of
the houses were almost barricaded, the windows shut with wooden
shutters. One of the first memories I have is of sleeping in my
grandmother's bed and my grandmother telling me stories about the
massacre of the Armenians, and how she and my grandfather hid Armenians
in the cellar of their home … The Armenians were lustier, their history
a much bolder, more rebellious one. The Greeks were crafty, they did not
rebel and they did not get killed as much. … [In America, m]y father
traded in rugs. He was brought to this country by my uncle, who had a
great deal of energy and cunning. They say the Jews have cunning, that
they're sly people: the Anatolian Greeks are the same kind of people. If
you want to know why: they couldn't protect themselves by force, by the
sword or by arms, they were constantly being demeaned, so the only way
they could get along was by being sly, by never saying the wrong thing.
The first thing I learned was to shut up. My father used to tell us:
'Say nothing, don't mix in, don't mix in other people's business, stay
out of trouble,' and that of course was the very opposite of the Yankee
tradition. My first wife was a Yankee; her tradition was never to say
anything except exactly what you felt and say it immediately without any
omission or qualification. That's one of the reasons I admired and loved
her so much: she was the opposite of the way I was brought up. But I was
cautious and careful and crafty."</p>
