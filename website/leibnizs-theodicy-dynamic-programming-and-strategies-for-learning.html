		<div><p>Leibniz, in his <em>Essais de Théodicée</em> (1710, I), says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Il demeure toujours vrai … qu'il y a une infinité de Mondes possibles,
dont il faut que Dieu ait choisi le meilleur; puisqu'il ne fait rien
sans agir suivant la suprême Raison.</p>
<p>[It always remains true ... that there are an infinity of possible
Worlds, from which it must be that God would have chosen the best,
since he does nothing without acting in accordance with supreme
Reason.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Leibniz has been roundly ridiculed for this sentiment. Apparently he
rejects the desirability of finding optimal subproblems, in the logical
sense, within moral philosophy. Coming from the coiner of the term
<em>differential</em> and what remains (300 years on) its modern symbol, this
seems inconsistent. Then again, maybe it is Leibniz's detractors who
fail to see the possibility of optimal subproblems in the order of the
universe, because they are distracted by the immediacy of human
suffering. Perhaps Leibniz thinks that all this really does even out
algorithmically.</p>
<p>The question of efficiency strategies is much on my mind these days, as
I have been trying to master the units on dynamic programming and greedy
algorithms before tomorrow's final exam in Algorithms. There has been
ample time, but somehow I never use time as effectively as I might, and
I wonder if the subject itself does not contain lessons for me, going
forward.</p>
<p>In the past year, calendar 2011, I have made headway clearing my desk of
obligations from my past academic life. My mind is clearer, too. Though
not as clear as I wish, since it has been cluttered with the new
learning I have taken in during two semesters of Data Structures and
Algorithms this year, the heart of the mathematical poetry that
underlies computer science. It has been a good year and I think it will
remain a memorable one for me, if perhaps not the best of all possible
years.</p>
<p>I use the word "cluttered" advisedly above, since it seems to me that
while I am perhaps able to study with preplanned efficiency, my mind
does not learn that way itself. In particular, my mind seems to require
a distinctly inefficient period of "shaking down" what I have learned
before it displays any comfort with new learning, to say nothing of
mastery. A really efficient learning strategy would include provision
for that process.</p></div>
