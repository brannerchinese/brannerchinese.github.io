		<div><p>Another week of Hacker School has passed and we are now at the halfway
mark. If I learn as much between now and the end as I have since I got
here, I'll be in a state of mind I can hardly imagine yet. I've been
well aware that my academic life has set me a very high bar for mastery
of ideas and methods, and that I am nowhere near being able to reach
that bar in programming. But I am not in a hurry, or more exactly I am
terribly eager to learn more and do so faster, but at the same time my
patience with the process is increasing as I gain a broader view of the
field before me. I try not to think of the vastness and depth of the
field in terms of my own scale, and that helps fertilize the growth of
patience.</p>
<p>A moment for observing myself: While helping my dictionary coauthor
apply for promotion and then preparing a conference paper last weekend I
happened to re-run the code I wrote for these two substantial projects
in the Summer and Fall. And as result of that I took a good, fresh look
at the code and realized just how much I had learned in the first five
weeks of Hacker School, and how much I would do differently now. That
was quite a lesson.</p>
<p>My chief reflection is that now, at the halfway point, Hacker School has
pushed aside almost everything else in my life. The only dreams I can
remember in the mornings are of writing and debugging code. I have
ceased to follow any coherent exercise plan, although I'm still doing my
150 squats while the others in the mid-afternoon pushup group are doing
pushups. I'm pretty sure I'm not getting enough sleep, but I still feel
too stimulated to try to get more. I haven't been getting written the
daily diaries I send to a few friends, and on Thursday I even failed to
keep my own internal record of tasks accomplished, although I did get a
lot of code written and a few additions made to my running list of
methods and tricks learned.</p>
<hr />
<p>One of the recipients of my daily records, ever thoughtful, wrote to ask
about the place of drive in the Hacker School experience:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm curious how much of the benefit of this experience is the result
of your commitment to set aside uninterrupted time for learning, how
much of it comes from being in an environment with others driven to
learn independently (and perhaps some competitiveness on your part in
such environments?), and how much of it comes from actual engagement
with peers who can assist you at key moments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My first thought is that I would not underestimate the level of
commitment and competitiveness among programmers among all levels,
including even novices who have not yet written a single working
program. As a matter of culture, Hacker School promotes the ideal that
we should avoid some of the roughness of explicit competitiveness, but
of course it's there in what drives many of us. I try to be gentle with
my peers and (in my other life as a teacher) my students, but I think
competitiveness is healthy, just as collaboration is.</p>
<p>Internal drives aside, the mixture of self-directed independent work and
"pairing" is key to the experience here. I could write about that for
several hours, but I don't feel the time for doing so has come yet.</p>
<p>I should also mention the selection process through which my "batch" or
cohort entered Hacker School. The School's first two batches are said to
have been made up of friends and the friends of friends. But the
admission process has been more elaborate since then. I didn't find it
unpleasant or stressful in any way. The other day, over a meal with
three of my batch, I mused that there really is no one the least bit
unpleasant or uninteresting in this whole batch — and whatever
heuristics were applied internally by the faculty during
application-vetting and interviews, the results impress me. And I
consider myself well prepared to appreciate the effectiveness of this
process process, having hired and managed personnel and overseen
students in all sorts of different educational programs.</p>
<hr />
<p>My inquiring friend continued:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A related thought would be: What percentage of your HaSch cohort seem
to feel the same as you about its rewards? If independent and
uninterrupted work is the key factor, since that is a rare skill, even
with the selection effects of opting into the school and being chosen,
I might expect that only a small number truly feel they are getting as
much benefit as you (although others might fool themselves).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is hard to gauge the state of things so as to answer conclusively in
a few words. Self-direction is a central part of the experience at
Hacker School. Some people seem to be coding socially much more of the
time than others, but I suppose that is a temperamental choice and there
is room for different styles.</p>
<p>Some of our number have said that their learning and planning strategies
were poor in the first weeks — that they didn't use their time well or
even know what they should be doing. How things may have changed since
then I can't say. That would make an interesting topic for a survey
toward the end of the batch. But my view is that even a gross
miscalculation here doesn't derail self-direction; it provides new
opportunities to evaluate what one is doing and redirect oneself. And
evaluating oneself is the key thing, while never making foolish mistakes
is as good as impossible. So I don't take poor initial planning too
seriously — I don't consider it a damning error.</p>
<p>Anecdotally, everyone I have asked considers Hacker School an
exceptional adventure of growth and self-cultivation. Some people are
hoping to find work as a direct outcome of participation in the batch,
but not everyone by any means. That's a further complication in
answering questions about what drives people. And things are organized
so that the recruitment component of Hacker School has been discussed
very little in these past six weeks.</p></div>
