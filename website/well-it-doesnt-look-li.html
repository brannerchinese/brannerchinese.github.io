		<div><p>For two days short of a full calendar year I have been keeping a wiki of
my computing notes. A wiki, a lightly organized website structure, is
much better than a nest of files in subdirectories if you are trying to
keep track of what you have learned and accumulate a record of your
experiments and experience. And running it on a server means it is
available to you more or less everywhere.</p>
<p>I have been using MediaWiki, the software that powers Wikipedia. I know
it pretty well, having fiddled with Wikipedia ever since it emerged from
the miasma of unrealized memes. But this year of MediaWiki has been
frustrating. The application is good for mixing markdown with HTML —
markdown is very low maintenance and HTML is helpful when you want fine
control of formatting or to include something from a website — but MW's
brand of markdown sometimes has small problems (for instance, numbering
of an ordered list sometimes resets when a line of "preformatted"
content is interspersed among the numbered items). And a whole MediaWiki
site is not so easy to back up — the simplest thing is to dump the whole
MySQL database, but then that's a large file to deal with every day.</p>
<p>Finally this morning I broke down and installed MoinMoin, and
transferred my whole MediaWiki database into it. MoinMoin isn't as good
with HTML as MediaWiki is, but its brand of markdown is simpler than
MediaWiki's. I like the fact that each page is stored as a flat
text-file, meaning that backup with mercurial is very efficient — only
individual diff patch-files are pushed to server.</p>
<p>I dare say markdown will replace HTML in many environments.</p>
<p>Best of all, MoinMoin looks pretty good in w3m, my text-only browser of
choice.</p>
<hr />
<p></p>
For a while it didn't look as though I would be permitted to post this.
WordPress has drastically redone its software, and I could no longer see
most of what I had written; nor could I preview my text or assign
categories to it. Beside the non-functional text field there was a
little remark: "Blogs are not just for long posts. Why not post a photo
or video instead?"</p>
<p>I chose WordPress over other sites because I liked their software; it
seemed the best tool for what I wanted to do. If I stop liking it, the
whole relationship will be in danger. I don't mean to sound like a
pretty girl with too many suitors, but no company should take my
patronage for granted. I don't need a slick interface — not at all — and
I don't need social media. If that's all you have for me, it's "goombye
pliz".</p>
<hr />
<p></p>
(grumble, grumble, a little later)</p>
<p>After posting the abortion of this note as a "quotation" (since
WordPress's parsers determined that there was no content in the original
"text" format), I later became able to edit it in the familiar
interface, with the minimum functionality I require. What a mess. If
your product works, leave it alone, people.</p>
<hr />
<p></p>
Yes, I said text-only browser. W3m, made in Japan, the homeland of
craftsmanship. I am a man of command-line temperament and of words
written and then revised and then revised again. Spare me your sticky
GUI; spare! o spare me your tweets and friending and live webcam feeds,
and let me type what I have to type and have it read by those who have
the patience to read.</p></div>
