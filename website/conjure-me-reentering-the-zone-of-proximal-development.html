		<div><p>This evening Mel Chua (<a href="http://melchua.com">http://melchua.com</a>) spoke at Hacker School
about educational psychology in application to learning to be a better
coder. Among many interesting ideas, she introduced the notion of the
"zone of proximal development," a state of partial competence in the
presence of some more competent party or in a collaborative environment.
Of course, if you think about it, much of our learning takes place in
such a zone. She had interesting things to say about how Hacker School's
educational model, which you might call "the collective drives of
individuals in loose association", encourages this particular kind of
learning, neither wholly independent nor whole subordinate to an
expert's direction.</p>
<p>This idea led me to reflect on an important element of my own
problem-solving experience. When I'm in a bind — usually not thinking as
clear-headedly as I could about something — if I then imagine myself in
conversation with someone I think of as smarter or more rational or more
sensible than I am, I soon perceive some good, some unexpected
suggestion made to me by that person. It seems to come to me from that
person. Well, the person was not actually there; at times the person is
even dead and disintegrated. But the suggestion I perceive them making
normally helps me get past my own block.</p>
<p>Even though this suggestion will have arisen entirely within my own
mind, my mind seems to require the catalyst of envisioning it coming
from someone else. I suspect that what is really happening is that my
brain is somehow reviving or reenacting the past experience of having
had such a person force me to think in an unaccustomed way, and that
process of reenactment leads me to a new way of envisioning the
situation I am now dealing with.</p>
<p>I have taken to trying to convey to my students the value of this
experience. I tell them in so many words that after our class has ended
and they have gone off to other tasks, to "conjure me" when they face a
difficult problem in the future — try to hear my voice then, to recall
then what my responses to them have been now, as we are cutting our way
through the jungle of Classical Chinese grammar together. If my own
experience is a guide, then having with them the example of my guidance
will enable their own minds to solve problems in ways that may have
escaped their attention.</p>
<p>I mean that the past guidance of others sometimes enables us to learn —
really to learn, and really to think in a fresh way — even when we are
actually alone. It seems to me that the zone of proximal development
doesn't always require actual proximity to other people.</p>
