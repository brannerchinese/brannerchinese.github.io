		<div><p>Addressing a class of young military officers, William Deresiewicz says:</p>
<p>
> I find for myself that my first thought is never my best thought. My
> first thought is always someone else's; it's always what I've already
> heard about the subject, always the conventional wisdom. It's only by
> concentrating, sticking to the question, being patient, letting all
> the parts of my mind come into play, that I arrive at an original
> idea. By giving my brain a chance to make associations, draw
> connections, take me by surprise. And often even that idea doesn't
> turn out to be very good. I need time to think about it, too, to make
> mistakes and recognize them, to make false starts and correct them, to
> outlast my impulses, to defeat my desire to declare the job done and
> move on to the next thing.

<blockquote>
<p>…</p>
<p><p>
Solitude can mean introspection, it can mean the concentration of
focused work, and it can mean sustained reading. All of these help you
to know yourself better. But there's one more thing I'm going to
include as a form of solitude, and it will seem counterintuitive:
friendship. Of course friendship is the opposite of solitude; it means
being with other people. But I'm talking about one kind of friendship
in particular, the deep friendship of intimate conversation. Long,
uninterrupted talk with one other person. … This is what we call
thinking out loud, discovering what you believe in the course of
articulating it. But it takes just as much time and just as much
patience as solitude in the strict sense.</p>
