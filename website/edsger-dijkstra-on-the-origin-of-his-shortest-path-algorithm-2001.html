		<div><p>In an oral history interview with Philip Frana in 2001, Edsger Dijkstra
remembers the circumstances of the discovery of his shortest path
algorithm:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One morning I was shopping in Amsterdam with my young fiancée, and
tired, we sat down on the café terrace to drink a cup of coffee and I
was just thinking about whether I could do this, and I then designed
the algorithm for the shortest path. As I said, it was a twenty-minute
invention. In fact, it was published in ’59, three years late. The
publication is still readable, it is, in fact, quite nice. One of the
reasons that it is so nice was that I designed it without pencil and
paper. I learned later that one of the advantages of designing without
pencil and paper is that you are almost forced to avoid all avoidable
complexities. Eventually that algorithm became, to my great amazement,
one of the cornerstones of my fame.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>It was originally published in 1959 in a German article in <em>Numerische
Mathematik</em>. F.L. Bauer had founded that journal and he was soliciting
for articles. Now, at the time, something like an algorithm for the
shortest path, that was hardly considered mathematics: there was a
finite number of ways of going from A to B and obviously there is a
shortest one, so what’s all the fuss about? So that is why it remained
unpublished, but when Bauer asked whether we could contribute
something, I said, yes, I could, because in the mean time I had also
designed the shortest subspanning tree. I had done that for my
hardware friends. You know, on the big panel you have to connect a
whole lot of points with the same copper wire because they have to
have the same voltage. How do you minimize the amount of copper wire
that connects these points? So I wrote an article “A note on two
problems in connection with graphs” or something like that. But now,
when I went to my ophthalmologist — and to the best of my knowledge he
did not even know that I was a computing scientist — he said, ‘Have
you designed the algorithm for GPS?” It turned out he had seen the
Scientific American of last November [2000].</p>

<p>I recommend the full interview, which touches on many matters of
interest in the history of computers and computer science. The site
itself contains transcripts of several hundred interviews in this field,
conducted between 1973 and (to date) 2009.</p>
