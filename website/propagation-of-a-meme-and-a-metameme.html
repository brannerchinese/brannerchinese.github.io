		<div><p>I received a humorous circular from a friend, arguing that one of the
large-scale design features of the space shuttle derives from the gauge
of the Roman wheel-rut, designed to accommodate the width of two
chariot-horses. The punchline is "so horses' arses control everything."</p>
<p>A few minutes' Internet search traces the core of this message back to a
1994 posting: <a href="http://www.langston.com/Fun_People/1994/1994ADL.html">http://www.langston.com/Fun_People/1994/1994ADL.html</a>
(appended below for the record, lest it vanish; accessed 20120102).</p>
<p>I doubt very much that was the first year it appeared. But it's
interesting to see how long these things propagate for. February of 1994
was just about the time I started using the Internet again, after a
hiatus of 14 or 15 years. I have a vague recollection of having seen it
around that time, and of remembering then that I had heard a
school-buddy recounting something similar in the 1970s.</p>

<p>US Standard Railroad Gauge</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>How MilSpecs Live Forever</p>
<hr />
<p>The US standard railroad gauge (distance between the rails) is 4 ft 8
1/2</p>
<p>in (1.44 m). That's an exceedingly odd number.</p>
<p>Why is that gauge used? Because that's the way they built them in
England,</p>
<p>and the US railroads were built by English ex patriots.</p>
<p>Why did the English build 'em like that? Because the first rail lines
were</p>
<p>built by the same people who built the pre-railroad tramways, and
that's</p>
<p>the gauge they used.</p>
<p>Why did *they* use that gauge then? Because the people who built the</p>
<p>tramways used the same jigs and tools as they used for building
wagons,</p>
<p>which used that wheel spacing.</p>
<p>OK! Why did the wagons use that wheel spacing? Well, if they tried to
use</p>
<p>any other spacing the wagons would break on some of the old, long
distance</p>
<p>roads, because that's the spacing of the ruts.</p>
<p>So who built these old rutted roads? The first long distance roads in</p>
<p>Europe were built by Imperial Rome for the benefit of their legions.
The</p>
<p>roads have been used ever since.</p>
<p>And the ruts? The initial ruts, which everyone else had to match for
fear</p>
<p>of breaking their wagons, were first made by Roman war chariots. Since
the</p>
<p>chariots were made by or for Imperial Rome they were all alike in the</p>
<p>matter of wheel spacing (ruts again).</p>
<p>Thus we have the answer to the original question.</p>
<p>The United States standard railroad gauge of 4 ft 8 1/2 in derives
from the</p>
<p>original military specification (MilSpec) for an Imperial Roman army
war</p>
<p><p>
chariot. MisSpecs [dpb: sic] (and bureaucracies) live forever!</p>
