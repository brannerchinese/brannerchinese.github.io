		<div><p>I am now a member of the Institute for Advanced Study and I had my first
tour of the place on Friday. It resembles nothing so much as a cloister
designed to facilitate scholarship. The campus is isolated from
Princeton University and all shopping — even food and coffee, while
within reach, are rather limited. (I've brought my own coffee delivery
system.) The whole institute is compact but has plenty of room for walks
to stimulate thinking and conversation.</p>
<p>The administrative staff bends over backwards to ensure that scholars
have the material support we need. I am impressed at the range of
equipment that is available and the speed at which what isn't gets
delivered. I requested a second computer monitor and it came within the
day; I asked for help setting up a proper standing workstation and by
day's end had a visit from someone who knew all the options — although
he said it was the first such request he'd ever heard of — and arranged
for adjustment of the furniture and delivery. This goes well beyond
anything I've ever experienced in an academic setting before. Money is
available to buy equipment and pay the staff to administer it, but more
than that, the Institute is willing to spend it the money and deploy the
staff for my comfort, and to do so on almost no notice.</p>
<p>In the library, too, it's clear that someone has gone to trouble to make
sure that there are scanners, capable of batch work or oversize imaging,
and a range of other mechanical tools to aid research. But I was
surprised to see that the system for checking out books is still manual.
The borrower fills out two cards for each book. One is filed under his
own name and the other by call number. Since the catalog is already set
up as a modern database, someone could write a program to track books
and users in a couple of hours, as if one did not already exist. Why has
the Institute not moved to do so? A puzzle.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is because the need is not pressing — there seem to be no
more than a couple of hundred users at any time — and because retaining
the cards, with the signatures of previous borrowers on them for anyone
to see, allows a pleasant old tradition to survive. It's pleasant for
me, anyway. I realize that most library users today may never have
encountered this, but I used to take great pleasure in seeing the names
of people who had borrowed a book before me, especially when it was
decades earlier or the borrower was someone well known.</p>
<p>I see the use of cards as another sign of care for the study
environment.</p></div>
