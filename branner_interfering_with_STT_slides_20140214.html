        <div>
          <ul class="incremental">
            <li><strong>Goal</strong>: To measure the effectiveness of different ways to interfere with automated voice transcription.</li>
            <li><strong>Remarks</strong>: Normally we want to improve the quality of voice-recognition, for instance in the use of tools for the hearing-impaired, automated stenography, or giving verbal instructions to a robotic servant.</li>
            <li>Today I want to consider the reverse question: What means do I have to confound automatic voice recognition and transcription?</li>
            <li>I used Google's automated transcription of voicemail for this project, because of its convenience.</li>

            <li>Google returns both a whole string of text and a word-by-word list, showing the confidence with which each word is transcribed:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>gc-word-high</code> vs.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>gc-word-med2</code> vs.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>gc-word-med1</code><br><br>Here I ignore these confidence values and only treat the whole string. This lowers accuracy somewhat.</li>
            <li>I consider only whole words, normalized (with NLTK and other tools) to ignore small morphological variations (so &ldquo;saves&rdquo;, &ldquo;saved&rdquo;, &ldquo;saving&rdquo; &#x2192; &ldquo;save&rdquo;). Numerals zero to ten (ordinal and cardinal) are also converted to words. All this raises accuracy somewhat.</li>

      <h1>Measuring transcription accuracy</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Google supplies a transcription composed of well-formed English words, so there is no question of typographical errors, for which edit distance would be a useful quantification tool.</p>
          <p>Instead, given an original string <code>s1</code> and a transcription string <code>s2</code>, I look for the longest common substring of <code>s1</code> in <code>s2</code> together with whatever other matching material is found on either side of it interspersed with non-matching material.</p>
          <p>The Ratcliff/Obserhelp algorithm was developed to accomplish this task by John W. Ratcliff and John A. Obershelp in 1983 for application to problems in educational software (Ratcliff and Metzener, 1988). Ratcliff called it "Wild-card search that doesn't require wild cards; &hellip; the algorithm creates its own wildcards." It is not the most efficient LCS algorithm, though.</p>
          <p>The algorithm is implemented in Python using a queue rather than recursion.</p>
