		<div><p>Today, three weeks from the end of my Java course, I am finally working
my way through the Android training tools.</p>
<p>I am moved to reflect that some people assume technology will solve all
their problems, but that I am not one of them.</p>
<p>To me, technology embodies and concentrates all the qualities of the
human congener — it has wonderful potential, but anything may go wrong
with it. Even though I know that, I am always disturbed when I find
subtle (or gross) discrepancies between published descriptions and
actual function, even though my working model of the universe takes it
as a premise that such discrepancies abound.</p>
<p>Here
(http://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/creating-project.html),
on day 1 of my studies, I find that the New Android App window in
Eclipse is supposed to contain a "Build SDK" item. Well, there is no New
Android App window in my copy of Eclipse — there is a New Android
Application window. And on it there is no "Build SDK" item. There are
more items than are shown in the tutorial, and one of them ("Compile
With") is probably equivalent, but the literal item named for me to look
for is missing. The tutorial has not been kept current. I can tell now
that, at some point in the future, it is going to lead me into outright
error.</p>
<p>Well, my working model of the universe takes that as a premise, so who
am I to complain? Causality proceeds as if following hashes in a hash
table — you yourself can't usually tell where a given hash will take you
just by inspection, but it does take you there, unfailingly. The problem
is that when you are given a roadmap showing a subtly different hash
than the one in the roadmap, there is no telling how far off you may end
up.</p>
<p>But I am proceeding anyway, in the state of mind I call "black
optimism": I expect the worst, but am confident I'll get through it even
so.</p></div>
