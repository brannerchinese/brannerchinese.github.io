		<div><p>Andrew Nathan describes two of the many trenchant observations in <a href="http://www.asianbarometer.org/newenglish/network/DohChullShin.htm">Doh
Chull Shin</a>'s new study of democracy in East Asia, (<em>Confucianism and
Democratization in East Asia</em>). From Nathan's review:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In China, 65 percent of respondents endorsed democracy in principle,
but only 28 percent considered the opportunity to change governments
through elections to be essential to democracy, and fewer than four
percent said that the freedom to criticize people in power is
essential.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The values of people in Confucian Asia are no more Confucian than
those of people elsewhere; indeed, they are often less so. Smaller
proportions of citizens in the region are devoted to paternalistic
meritocracy than in non-Confucian Asia, which Shin defines as
Indonesia, Malaysia, Mongolia, the Philippines, and Thailand. Compared
with six other regions studied in the World Values Survey, Confucian
Asia is only the fourth-most hierarchical, after the Muslim world,
Africa, and Latin America. A plausible interpretation of such findings
is that so-called Confucian values are not distinctively Asian at all;
instead, they belong to a more universal category of traditional
values. That interpretation gains support from the fact that the
countries of Confucian Asia are far from monolithic in their norms and
beliefs. Fewer than seven percent of Japanese adhere to hierarchical
values, compared with more than 40 percent of Vietnamese; more than
half of South Koreans are egalitarians, compared with only 30 percent
of Chinese.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shin uses data from extensive surveys conducted in 2005–08 by the World
Values Survey Association and the Asian Barometer Survey. Nathan argues
in favor of (carefully conducted) surveys as a better tool for studying
the beliefs "of" a society than pronouncements by public intellectuals
and ideologues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The survey method remains indispensable. No other approach does as
good a job of finding out what large numbers of people actually
believe. And it is less reductive than the older method of gesturing
in the direction of an entire nation and claiming that all its members
share some vaguely defined set of norms.</p>
