		<div><p>Two years ago I got a wonderful HTC Android smartphone, but last year I
decided to cancel the subscription and went back to my old cellphone. My
old phone has better sound and is much easier to answer, hang up, and
dial than the HTC phone or indeed any other smartphone I've tried. I
rarely play mobile games, and I'm never without something to read on the
subway — I almost always have a programming manual or piece of
non-fiction in my pack, and for that matter I still get the Wall Street
Journal in paper (it comes free with an academic on-line subscription).
I was glad to save \$60 a month in connectivity fees, and I haven't
minded using the Android only offline or occasionally with WiFi. My
Verizon Wireless cellphone plan is \$30 a month for 100 minutes and 250
text messages, and these days I never exceed the quota.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I was headed to a breakfast meeting on Bond Street.
Google Maps, to which I turned the night before, gave me its always
reliable and accurate map and travel times, and I arrived at the Hoyt
Street Station in Brooklyn and walked to the address on Bond St. in
about two minutes.</p>
<p>No one was there. There was also no café there. I then remembered that
there was a Bond St. in New York, too, but couldn't recall exactly
where. The woman in the subway booth had never heard of it. Time was
short. I knew this Bond St. was in lower Manhattan somewhere, but
getting from Brooklyn to near an imprecisely known New York neighborhood
by subway involves a certain amount of intelligent gambling. I took the
train back to 14th St. and 7th Avenue, but various people working at
that station hadn't heard of Bond St., New York, either. They also had
no suggestion as to how I might find it. In the old days, the people in
the subway booths and the track workers seemed to know every street in
the city, but apparently those days are gone.</p>
<p>Passing strangers also knew only of the Brooklyn Bond St. I went out of
the station for a cell phone signal and called the MTA's help line,
which is entirely automated now. It put me on hold after failing to
understand my instructions. After ten minutes, it directed me to look on
the internet, which of course I couldn't do, and then hung up.</p>
<p>Finally, a young man with a smartphone took 30 seconds out of his day
and found Bond Street for me. Of course! It's one block below Great
Jones Street on either side of Lafayette! I cross it on nearly every
walk I take to Chinatown, and am always in a good mood when I do because
the name Great Jones Street always makes me happy. I hustled there on
foot — the man with the smartphone was amazed that I didn't want to go
by subway, but that would have been much more complicated. I made it to
the breakfast gathering an hour late, but still in time to meet a most
interesting person. I had the sense that my persistence in getting to my
destination was an omen of gaining a worthwhile acquaintanceship.</p>
<p>It's clear that without some sort of connectivity, I cannot make up for
the erosion of public intellectual infrastructure that is now normal in
the city. Many people just don't hold the same amount of information in
the brains that they — that all of us — used to. Of course, subway
workers still can't necessarily use their smartphones underground, and
as a result they have much less information than even ordinary
passengers do when we stand near the exits. These days I don't travel
all that much to unfamiliar places, and having a smartphone or connected
tablet is still not as urgent for me as it was a few years ago, but I
have the sensation that that will change soon.</p></div>
