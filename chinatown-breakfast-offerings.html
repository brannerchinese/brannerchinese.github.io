		<div><p>New York's Chinatown is a popular feeding ground at lunch and dinner
time, but I recommend it for breakfast, too. Below I describe the what
but not the where. The main types of offerings are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Dim sum, now a familiar event in the culinary repertoire of New
    Yorkers. Ideally, it is a brunch or afternoon tea snack served along
    with a pot of good plain or flower-infused black tea. The "sum" is
    correctly pronounced somewhat like the English word <em>sum</em>; don't
    change the vowel to the English short <em>oo</em>.</li>
<li>Congee and/or dumplings and/or another starch. In traditional
    Chinatown one generally gets the Cantonese and Chaozhou forms of
    these things. On East Broadway ("Fúzhōu Street"), Division St., and
    Eldridge St. these days there is also the Fúzhōu version of the
    same, which is quite distinctive. <em>Congee</em> is a word of Malay
    origin, from the same generation of East Asian vocabulary — which
    entered English in the time of Captain Cook — that supplied us with
    <em>catty</em> and <em>bamboo</em>, among others.</li>
<li>The bun and pastry experience, also associated with tea or coffee
    but less distinctive than dim sum and the venues generally less
    genteel.</li>
</ol>
<p>Dim sum is too well documented to need discussion here. It is suited to
groups of three to ten people, although there's nothing quite like a
nice table for two. I like to think that dim sum is more a tool to
stimulate conversation than a kind of food.</p>
<p>Buns and pastry are easily figured out — the most unusual may be the
fried sesame ball or <em>jiānduī</em> 煎堆, a ball of glutinous rice dough,
filled with red bean paste or the less-sweet yellow lotus-seed paste,
deep fried and coated in sesame seeds.</p>
<p>The middle group — congee, dumplings, and starches — are immensely
diverse and grade into the normal range of Chinese cooking — meat and
vegetables, and so on. Since I typically walk to Chinatown for breakfast
and am more thirsty than hungry when I arrive, I tend to have soup with
dumplings in it. There's a lot to say about the soup-offerings, but in a
few words here are the most distinctive choices:</p>
<ol>
<li>shrimp/pork dumpling soup (many venues; these are various called
    <em>yúntūn</em> 雲吞 or <em>húndùn</em> 餛飩 "wontons" or <em>shuǐjiǎo</em> 水餃);</li>
<li>white pepper-seasoned dumpling with fish-based rather than
    flour-based skin (Cháozhōu, one venue at breakfast-time, "<em>yúpíjiǎo</em>
    魚皮角);</li>
<li>celery-tinctured pork or mutton maw soup (Fúzhōu, one venue I know
    of, <em>zhū/yángdǔguàn</em> 豬/羊肚罐子 — you will probably hear 肚
    rendered <em>dù</em>);</li>
<li>glutinous-rice dumpling balls filled with highly seasoned pork
    (Fúzhōu, much the same place to place because not made in-house,
    <em>yuánxiāo</em> 元宵)</li>
<li>dumpling with pork-based rather than flour-based skin (Fúzhōu, much
    the same place to place because not made in-house, <em>yànwán</em> 燕丸);</li>
<li>cornstarch based floppy noodle-like thing (Fúzhōu, "<em>yànmiàn</em>
    燕麵");</li>
<li>pork dumplings with shepherd's purse (<em>jìcài</em> 薺菜, though you may
    hear 薺 as <em>qí</em>) or the strong-tasting Chinese "leek" (<em>jiǔcài</em>
    韭菜); these are northern, and there are several venues right now,
    all very low-end — your soup is served in a plastic take-out
    container, rather than a bowl.</li>
</ol>
<p>Good soup of course depends primarily on good stock, and part of my
pleasure in exploring the breakfast offerings is sampling what different
chefs can do with bones and water each morning before the restaurants
open.</p></div>
