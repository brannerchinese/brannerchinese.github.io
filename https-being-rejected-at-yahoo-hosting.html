		<div><p>Someone mentioned that an HTTPS link to a website of mine would not
open, while the same request sent as plain HTTP worked normally. That
would be something quite new — HTTPS requests to my site were working as
recently as last night; I know because I made many of them while writing
a webpage.</p>
<p>So I looked up some other sites hosted by Yahoo — choosing some that
Yahoo uses to advertise its hosting service (at
http://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/webhosting), sites I could be sure are
indeed currently resident at Yahoo. I confirmed independently that they
are hosted there: <code>whois</code> lists yahoo.com name servers for all of them.
Among the sites are:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://chefaimee.com</li>
<li>https://papayadayspa.com</li>
<li>https://graceharborindustries.com</li>
<li>https://ju-jitsu-center.com</li>
</ul>
<p>etc. Indeed, all open only with HTTP, not HTTPS.</p>
<p>It may, of course, be an anomalous outage of some sort; none of the
sites I checked actually supports secure connections for payment. But my
untowardly suspicious mind imagines the problem to be connected to
today's various blackouts in protest against SOPA. The URLs I use to
work on my site, as well as one of Yahoo's secure sites for its own
business (https://order.smallbusiness.yahoo.com/order/choosedomain?),
have no trouble being accessed by HTTPS, which suggests that this is not
a Yahoo-wide problem.</p></div>
