		<div><p>Yesterday I went out looking for herring in order to follow <a href="http://brannerchinese.wordpress.com/2012/05/16/advice-on-preparing-herring/" title="Advice on preparing herring">the souring
recipe I wrote about earlier</a>.</p>
<p>The fish-counter man at Fairway 131st St. had never heard of herring and
tried to interest me in bacalao.</p>
<p>I escaped and made my way down to Citarella, where they really know
fish. No, they've had no herring in a long time. But I bought some fresh
mackerel filets and tried them instead. I was surprised that the souring
time is only a day — I'm used to living with the noxious vapors of
souring cabbage for a week or more (I use kimchee ingredients but
regular green cabbage instead of bokchoy, and I prefer habanero peppers,
which do not waste time making food redder than it is hot). For the
record, I used a red onion, fennel, and lots of dill.</p>
<p>Tonight it was ready. My wife, who does not believe in the existence of
pickled fish, made a face and said,
"今天家裡一直聞到一股臭味，不知道是什麼，我以為是老鼠尿。" [There was a
bad smell at home all day. I didn't know what it was; I thought it was
mouse urine.] I don't think it smells anything like mouse urine. But she
got well out of the way as I went to work transferring the fish to small
containers for the refrigerator.</p>
<p>It's pretty good. It's not at all salty — in fact, I think I'll add a
little salt to the remainder I put in the refrigerator. The flesh itself
is superb. The skin is a little tougher than I'm used to with commercial
soured herring, so the eating experience is somewhat new to me. But this
is much, much tastier than commercial soured herring — much milder, and
the fish is really wonderful.</p></div>
