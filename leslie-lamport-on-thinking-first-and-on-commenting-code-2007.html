<blockquote>
<p>The idea of doing something before coding is not so radical. Any
number of methods, employing varying degrees of formalism, have been
advocated. Many of them involve drawing pictures. The implicit message
underlying them is that these methods save you from the difficult task
of thinking. If you just use the right language or draw the right kind
of pictures, everything will become easy. The best of these methods
trick you into thinking. They offer some incentive in the way of tools
or screen-flash that sugar coats the bitter pill of having to think
about what you’re doing. The worst give you a happy sense of
accomplishment and leave you with no more understanding of what your
program is supposed to do than you started with. The more a method
depends on pictures, the more likely it is to fall in the latter
class.</p>
<p>At best, a method or language or formalism can help you to think in
one particular way. And there is no single way of thinking that is
best for all problems. I can offer only two general pieces of advice
on how to think. The first is to write. As the cartoonist Guindon once
wrote, “writing is nature’s way of showing you how fuzzy your thinking
is.” Before writing a piece of code, write a description of exactly
what that piece of code is supposed to accomplish. This applies
whether the piece is an entire program, a procedure, or a few lines of
code that are sufficiently non-obvious to require thought. The best
place to write such a description is in a comment.</p>
<p>People have come up with lots of reasons for why comments are useless.
This is to be expected. Writing is difficult, and people always find
excuses to avoid doing difficult tasks. Writing is difficult for two
reasons: (i) writing requires thought and thinking is difficult, and
(ii) the physical act of putting thoughts into words is difficult.
There’s not much you can do about (i), but there’s a straightforward
solution to (ii) — namely, writing. The more you write, the easier the
physical process becomes. I recommend that you start practicing with
email. Instead of just dashing off an email, write it. Make sure that
it expresses exactly what you mean to say, in a way that the reader
will be sure to understand it.</p>
<p><p>
Remember that I am not telling you to comment your code after you
write it. You should comment code before you write it.</p>
