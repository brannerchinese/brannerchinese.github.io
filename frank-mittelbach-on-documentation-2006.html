<blockquote>
<p>I think it is extremely valuable to combine the development of
software (actually anything) with the task of writing about it in some
way. Trying to explain to others the functions and concepts behind a
creation helps a lot in finding out whether or not something is going
to work in practice. If you can’t explain it or if the explanation
turns out to be horribly complicated, then there is something
fundamentally wrong with your creation and you should return to the
drawing board.</p>
<p>Very important here is that one does not stop at simply documenting
functions or menu items (though that is a start) but effectively tries
to document the usage flow and the reasons why one would do things in
one way or the other. Often enough (with free software as well as
commercial software) you find only rudimentary documentation that
tells you that such and such feature exists but never explains why one
would want to use the feature in the first place. That type of
documentation, while necessary, will not help in improving your tool
(and often enough it turns out that such features only got implemented
because they were easy to add without providing any real benefit).</p>
<p>So yes, documenting ideas and work flows has always been an integral
part for me of developing and/or improving software, both my own as
well as software from others. In The LATEX Companion, for example, a
good proportion of what I describe is software developed by others,
and the process of trying to explain how to use this software and
finding good usage examples led in many cases to improvements in
syntax or features after some discussions with the authors.</p>
<p>Therefore my advice to developers is to always try their hands at
documenting their own creations or at least find somebody who does it
for them (starting from the initial development!) — and carefully
evaluate the findings from this process: it will result in noticeable
improvements in the product.</p>
