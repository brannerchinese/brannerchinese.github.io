		<div><p>27 years after the great card catalog of the Columbia Libraries stopped
being updated, it is finally being removed altogether.</p>
<p>The card catalog was a powerful reference resource in itself; its index
cards bore carefully researched information to help identify places and
subjects, authors and their dates, and innumerable bibliographic details
that were sometimes not apparent even when one had the book in one's
hands.</p>
<p>The message that was received by Columbia faculty this morning, and
which is apparently not yet on line, reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This fall you will begin to see changes in Butler Library, Room 310 as
the Libraries begin the process to remove the card catalog. The
Subject catalog in the north end of the room, overlooking College
Walk. will be removed in 2013, followed by sections of the Name/Title
catalog in 2014. We will be removing the catalog furniture from the
center of the room and moving much of the Name/Title catalog to the
cabinets on the exterior walls at the south end of the room. Retaining
these catalog cards will ensure that no bibliographic information
important to scholarship will be lost in this process.</p>
<p>The card catalog has not been updated since 1985, when the libraries
introduced the online catalog, CLIO. As time has passed, the
information in the card catalog has become increasingly inaccurate.
Major historical changes, such as the break-up of the Soviet bloc in
1991 are not reflected. Additionally, the removal of the card catalog
provides the library with an opportunity to continue to improve,
update, and in some cases, add records to CLIO that were not included
in 1985 or in subsequent retrospective conversion projects. These
improvements to CLIO will be noticeable as early as this fall as we
begin to update the holdings information for journals and add missing
microfilm sets.</p>
<p>The removal of the card catalogs also enables the Libraries to
continue the transformation of Butler Library that began with the
recently completed renovation. Using the historical beauty of the
space as backdrop, Room 310 will be re-purposed to better serve the
emerging research needs of our students and faculty. Over time, Room
310 will be transformed into a Digital Humanities Center (DHC) where
scholars will be able to approach their research in new ways.
Knowledgeable subject specialist librarians and technologists will
help humanities scholars integrate deep research collections across
multiple formats with digital tools and new research methodologies â€“
all within a space honoring both the rich history of humanities
scholarship at Columbia and the architectural uniqueness of Butler
Library.</p>
<p>The removal of the card catalog will bring the Columbia University
Libraries in line with peer institutions that removed their card
catalogs in the last decade; New York University removed their catalog
in 2001, Harvard University in 2003, and Yale University in 2006.</p>
