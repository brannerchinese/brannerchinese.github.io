		<div><p>In 1992, I went to China on a Fulbright to do research in the remote
countryside. In China, anything like this hinges on personal
connections; paper credentials alone mean little. My chief supporter was
the father of a fellow student of mine — I had given my classmate
extensive help with her dissertation, and my professor had also done the
father many quiet courtesies. By the Chinese calculus of favor-debt,
this powerful person was obligated to my teacher and indirectly to me,
and he agreed to sponsor me and get me to the countryside, where I could
work under the radar.</p>
<p>When I reached China, however, my sponsor took me to the Party Secretary
in a small city and offered my services as an unsalaried English teacher
in a vocational school there, to pay off some other favor-debt of his
own. That would have ended my research and wasted two years of
preparation and a Federal grant. Within the Chinese moral system, as a
student I had no right to stand up to him, since our whole agreement was
informal — especially since he was proposing to bend rules for me just
as rules had earlier been bent for his daughter.</p>
<p>Once he left, I politely declined the teaching "job" and visited the
local government. I explained my situation, showed my letters of
authorization from Central Government ministries, and negotiated
official sponsorship by the local government. I relied on that
sponsorship to complete some three years of original research.</p>
<p>I had no preparation for the negotiation and did it under considerable
stress. But I learned more about China in those few days than in my
whole previous education.</p></div>
